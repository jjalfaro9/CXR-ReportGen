                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of end-stage renal disease.  Evaluate for evidence of
 congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  There are diffuse interstitial opacities
 radiating from the hila as well as Kerley B lines and vascular cephalization,
 consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  A ___-mm nodular opacity
 projects just superior to the right costophrenic angle.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  The right hilus is bulbous in appearance.  There are no
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild cardiomegaly with mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  ___-mm nodular opacity superior to the right costophrenic angle, possibly a
 calcified pulmonary nodule.  Further assessment with conventional radiographs
 should be performed once the patient's fluid status has normalized.
 
 3.  Bulbous appearance of the right hilus should be reassessed on the same
 conventional radiographs as recommended in impression point #2.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 7:41 a.m. via telehpone on ___.
