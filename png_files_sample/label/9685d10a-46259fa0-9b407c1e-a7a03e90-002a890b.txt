 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Pacemaker was inserted through the left subclavian approach with the battery

 location of right atrium and right ventricle.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is focal opacity along the right
 posterior inferior chest wall, more pronounced on the current study as
 compared to prior examination.  It might reflect loculated pleural effusion or
 rounded atelectasis since a consolidation in this area was demonstrated back
 in ___ but repeated evaluation given the interval increase in size
 is recommended to exclude the possibility of pleural neoplasm.  Calcification
