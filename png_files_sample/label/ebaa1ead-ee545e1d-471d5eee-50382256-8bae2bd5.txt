                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure s/p left thoracentesis
 // eval for extent of pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Following left thoracentesis, a left pleural effusion has substantially
 decreased in size with only a small pleural effusion remaining.  A smooth very
 small left apical pneumothorax is present and subsequently expands on
 separately dictated chest radiograph under clip ___, for which
 documentation of communication is provided (both radiographs are being
 interpreted concurrently).  Associated improved aeration of the left lung with
 nonspecific left perihilar airspace opacities which may reflect re-expansion
 edema.  A moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
