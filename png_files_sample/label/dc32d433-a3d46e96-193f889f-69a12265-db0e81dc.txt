                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well expanded.  Mildly increased opacity at the right
 lung base without a correlate on the lateral view is likely atelectasis but
 may represent earlier developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.
 Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.  There is no free air
 under the diaphragm. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: Faint opacity at the right lung base may represent atelectasis or
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
