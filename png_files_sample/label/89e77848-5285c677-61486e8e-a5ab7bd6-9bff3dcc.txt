                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with history of asthma, cough, sputum production
 and shortness of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___:
 
 Lungs are well expanded and clear.  There is no pleural abnormality.  Heart
 size is normal.  There is greater fullness in the right lower paratracheal
 station of the mediastinum, which could be due to distal distention of the
 azygos vein or development of enlarged lymph nodes in that region.  Patient
 has never had chest CT scanning.  If there is lymph node enlargement, there is
 no compromise of the airway, and therefore adenopathy would not explain
 shortness of breath.  The abnormality is not so large that chest CT is a clear
 indication.  Would examine the patient for evidence of adenopathy elsewhere. 
 Repeat chest radiograph in three to four weeks should show whether an acute
 lymph node enlargement has changed.
