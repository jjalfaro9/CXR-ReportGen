                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, vomiting, history of pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.  ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  Aorta remains mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There
 are persistent bibasilar airspace opacities, not significantly changed
 compared to the prior study.  No new parenchymal opacities are visualized. 
 Biapical pleural thickening is re- demonstrated.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change from prior.  Persistent bibasilar airspace
 opacities likely reflective of acute on chronic bronchitis and bronchiolitis
 with unchanged small left pleural effusion.
