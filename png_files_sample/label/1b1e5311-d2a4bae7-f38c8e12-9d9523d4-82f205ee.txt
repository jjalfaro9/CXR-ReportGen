                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There are patchy streaky opacities with volume loss in the
 lingula, not changed and accordingly most suggestive of atelectasis or
 scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Mild spinal
 degenerative changes are similar.
 
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute disease.
