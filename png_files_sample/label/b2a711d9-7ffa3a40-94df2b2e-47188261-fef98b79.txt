                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with bilateral pulmonary emboli, intubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two supine portable views of the chest.  Endotracheal tube tip is
 approximately 5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube passes below the field of
 view, side port past the GE junction.  On one view, there are low lung volumes
 with crowding of the bronchovascular markings with improvement on the second
 acquisition.  There is mild cardiomegaly potentially accentuated due to supine
 technique.  Prominence of the upper mediastinum does improve between the two
 views and is thought to be in part due to portable technique.  Calcification
 projecting over the right lung apex may be a calcified granuloma.  There is no
 confluent consolidation.
 
 Hyperdensity of the renal shadows seen bilaterally presumed from recent
 intravenous contrast administration can be seen in the setting of acute
 tubular necrosis if no recent CT scan has been performed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Endotracheal and enteric tubes in place.
 2.  Hyperdensity of the renal shadows bilaterally.  Assuming no recent CT scan
 has been performed in the past few hours, this persistent hyperdensity can be
 seen in the setting of acute tubular necrosis and correlation with serial
 creatinines is suggested.
