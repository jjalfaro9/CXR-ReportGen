                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever.  Please perform a
 lateral view to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal chest radiograph performed approximately one hour prior
 to this exam.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A leftward rotated AP view and a lateral view of the chest were
 obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The frontal view is extremely rotated to the left, with complete
 projection of the mediastinum over the left lung, which limits assessment. 
 The expanded right lung is unremarkable.  Assessment in the lateral view is
 also limited due to superimposition of the arms, but allowing for technical
 limitations, there is no spine sign, pleural effusion, or abnormality in the
 anterior mediastinum. No pneumothorax is identified.  Artifacts from external
 hair devices are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited examination.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
 process.
