 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:19 PM
  Near complete opacification of the left lung field with large pleural effusion
  and mild rightward mediastinal shift, slightly increased compared to CT dated
  ___ allowing for differences in modality. Persistent gastric distension.
  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 21:18 on ___ at time of

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rule out acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 There is a large left effusion, with obscuration of much of the left lung and
 of much of the left-sided cardiac silhouette, slightly increased compared to
 CT dated ___, allowing for differences in modality. There is probable mass
 effect on the left, with slight displacement of the cardiac silhouette to the
 right. 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  This may account for prominence of the
 vascular markings in the visualized portion of the lung.    The possibility of
 underlying CHF cannot be entirely excluded.  Again noted is some gaseous
 distension of the stomach.
 
 The patient's known L1 compression fracture is not well depicted and probably
 lies at the inferior edge of these images.  Background degenerative changes of
 the spine and shoulders are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Large left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and
 suspected slight mass effect on the heart, resulting in slight rightward
 shift.
 
 2.  Low inspiratory volumes may account for increased vascular markings.  CHF
 is considered less likely but cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 3.  Known right sclerotic rib lesion and heterogeneous attenuation in
 vertebral bodies see on the recent CT is not well depicted radiographically.
