                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with ESRD on HD presenting with acute anemia, evaluate
 evidence of effusion or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___ CT of the
 chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is enlarged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild with early
 pulmonary edema.  A small left pleural effusion is likely.  Opacity overlying
 the left mid lung could represent a focal consolidation or possibly fluid
 collecting within the left major fissure given the appearance on prior chest
 CT.  An infectious process should be considered in proper clinical setting.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Opacity in the left mid lung could represent focal consolidation or fluid
 within the fissure, clinical correlation for infectious process is
 recommended.  Follow-up radiographs to show resolution are suggested in ___
 weeks.
