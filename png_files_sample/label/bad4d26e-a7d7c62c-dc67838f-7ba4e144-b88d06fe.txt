                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with chest pain and left hip pain
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with severe emphysema again noted and diffuse chronic
 interstitial opacities.  More focal opacity within the left lower lobe
 periphery is compatible with the known lesion seen on the prior CT. No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Heart size is normal.  Diffuse
 atherosclerotic calcification of aorta is noted.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Severe emphysema with chronic interstitial abnormality.  More focal opacity in
 the periphery of the left lung base likely reflects the known lesion seen on
 prior chest CT.
