                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.  Evaluation for ET tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest obtained one hour
 prior, as well as radiographs of the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 interval endotracheal tube placement, in a relatively low-lying position,
 terminating 3 cm above the carina.  A nasoenteric tube is in place, with side
 hole below the level of the gastroesophageal junction, terminating in the
 stomach.  Overlying ventilation support devices are noted.  The lung volumes
 remain low, with progressed opacification in the right lung base, likely
 infectious.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no evidence of large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural thickening is noted, along
 with left basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube is slightly low-lying, and care should be taken to
 prevent further advancement.
 
 2.  Hazy opacity in the right lung base has progressed since the recent prior
 study, compatible with pneumonia.
