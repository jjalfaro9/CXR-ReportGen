 1.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A dual-lead
 left-sided pacer remains in place.  When compared to the prior study, there
 has been some interval improvement in the pulmonary edema; however, there has
 been interval development of a retrocardiac consolidation and patchy opacity
 at the right base which could reflect areas of atelectasis, aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There are likely layering
 effusions, left greater than right.  No pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube is
 seen coiled within the expected location of the stomach.
