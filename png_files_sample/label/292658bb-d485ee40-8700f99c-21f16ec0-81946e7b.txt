                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with history of gastric carcinoma, s/p abdominal
 surgery.  Assess central venous line position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 15:29.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval removal
 of a nasoenteric catheter.  A right internal jugular approach central venous
 catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction or just below.  A peritoneal
 drain terminates in the left upper quadrant, unchanged from prior.  Multiple
 surgical clips are seen in the region of the epigastrium.  A thoracic spine
 epidural catheter is in unchanged position.  Bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  Lung volumes are low, though no confluent consolidation
 is identified.  There is a rounded well-circumscribed lucency in the medial
 left lung apex just superior to the aortic knob.  The position and morphology
 are suggestive of air in the esophagus, though follow-up radiograph is
 recommended to exclude progression.  There is no large pleural effusion.  No
 pulmonary vascular congestion or interstitial edema is identified.  There is
 mild blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of small effusion,
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction or
 just below.
 2.  Persistent bibasilar atelectasis with probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions.
 3.  Rounded lucency in the medial left lung apex.  Findings likely represent
 air in the esophagus, though follow-up portable radiograph and dedicated PA
 and lateral chest radiographs when possible are recommended to exclude
 pneumomediastinum.
