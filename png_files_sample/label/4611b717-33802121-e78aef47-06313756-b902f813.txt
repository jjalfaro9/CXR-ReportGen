                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:30 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with acute hepatitis and liver failure.  Possible
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Diffuse and somewhat heterogeneous infiltrative pulmonary abnormality
 developed between ___ and ___ and worsened dramatically over the next
 ___ hours.  Since ___, it has worsened, and only minimally improved since
 ___.  The heterogeneity of the abnormality suggests diffuse infection
 and/or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding, and
 preceded the development of pulmonary abnormality, so I doubt that it is
 simply cardiogenic edema.  Noncardiogenic edema (ARDS) is another possibility.
 CT scanning would be useful to look for cavitation, which would confirm
 infection.
 
 With the chin elevated, tip of the endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet,
 4.5 cm above the carina is 2 cm above optimal placement.  Right internal
 jugular sheath ends in the upper SVC and right PIC line in the lower.  The
 upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Small
 pleural effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.
