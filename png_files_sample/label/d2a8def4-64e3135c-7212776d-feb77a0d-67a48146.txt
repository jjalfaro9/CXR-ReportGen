                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:29 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man.  Evaluate effusion and opacities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 2:21 p.m.:
 
 The diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has improved, while heart size
 has increased.  Despite the discrepancy, I suspect the pulmonary problem is
 largely cardiac edema, and decrease in mediastinal caliber suggests that at
 least central venous pressure has decreased.  ET tube is in standard
 placement.  The sharp definition of the ET tube cuff suggests secretions
 pooling in the airway above it.  These should be attended to clinically.
 
 NG tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Intra-aortic balloon pump
 unchanged in standard position.  Left pleural drain still in place.  No
 pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
