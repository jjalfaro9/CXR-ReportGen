 Heart size, mediastinum and tubes and lines appear to be unchanged.  There is
 interval improvement in vascular engorgement, consistent with improvement of
 pulmonary edema.  Heavy calcifications of the mitral annulus are demonstrated.
 No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen, but pleural effusion is most
