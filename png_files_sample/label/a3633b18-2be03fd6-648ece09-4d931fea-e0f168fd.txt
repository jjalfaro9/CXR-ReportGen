                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with confusion, lethargy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  7 mm nodular opacity projecting over
 the left lung base was not clearly seen on the prior examination.  Apart from
 atelectasis in the lung bases, the lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are
 mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild atelectasis of the lung bases without focal consolidation.
 2. 7 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left lung base is new in the
 interval, and could reflect a pulmonary nodule.  Consider nonemergent chest CT
 for further assessment.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Nonemergent chest CT can be considered for further
 assessment of the left basilar nodular opacity.
