                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Rapid atrial fibrillation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is mild unfolding along the
 aorta.  The aortic arch is calcified.  There is patchy left basilar opacity
 partly obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, seen only on the frontal view and
 most likely due to minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. 
 Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky left basilar opacity, probably minor atelectasis.  Mild
 cardiomegaly.
