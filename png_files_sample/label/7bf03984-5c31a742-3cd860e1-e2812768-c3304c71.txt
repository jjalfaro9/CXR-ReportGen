                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dementia presents with agitation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by rotation.  Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately
 enlarged, but unchanged.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively
 similar.  Previously noted mild interstitial pulmonary edema has essentially
 resolved.  There is continued opacification in the right lung base likely
 reflective of a combination of a small right pleural effusion and right
 basilar atelectasis.  Infection is not completely excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.  No additional focal consolidation is seen.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right basilar opacification, not substantially changed in the interval, likely
 a combination of small right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis. 
 Infection is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting.
