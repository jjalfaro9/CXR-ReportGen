                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status, found down.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, CT C-spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since the
 prior study, there is increased interstitial markings and bilateral opacities,
 predominantly in the perihilar region. The findings suggest pulmonary edema
 although concurrent infection cannot be excluded.  The heart is at least
 moderately enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is
 diffuse osteopenia with vertebral body loss of height in the thoracic spine. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Findings suggest pulmonary edema. Concurrent infection cannot be
 excluded.  Recommend repeat radiographs after treatment.
