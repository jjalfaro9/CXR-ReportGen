                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusion, evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy, cardiac
 enlargement and permanent pacer with dual intracavitary electrodes unchanged. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is no radiographic evidence
 of pleural effusion in the right hemithorax.  Previously present and described
 left-sided pleural effusion that obliterates the entire left-sided
 diaphragmatic contours and reaches up to the mid portion of the left lateral
 chest wall remains rather unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature in the upper
 left-sided pulmonary area is not congested and no acute infiltrates are seen. 
 Left lower lobe territory again obscured by the pleural densities and thus the
 underlying lung cannot be evaluated.
 
 The most recent chest CT of ___ is reviewed and indeed the partially
 collapsed left lower lobe is surrounded by the pleural effusion consistent
 with a trapped lung syndrome.  Noteworthy is, however, that at the same time
 widespread nodular lesions and ground-glass densities were identified in the
 right lung suspicious for other unrelated processes including malignancy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of left-sided unilateral pleural effusion.
