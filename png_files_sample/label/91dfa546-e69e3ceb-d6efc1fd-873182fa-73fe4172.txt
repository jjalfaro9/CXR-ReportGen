                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypotension, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___ and
 CT torso with contrast from ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable radiograph is provided.  Compared to the prior
 radiographs, lung volumes are low and there is volume loss in the right lower
 lobe.  Again seen is a large rounded opacity in the right lower lung zone,
 consistent with known lung mass.  Additional new nodules are seen superior to
 this primary mass, new from the prior study.  There is extensive pleural
 calcificatoin on the left.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural
 effusion.  Osseous structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Low lung volumes and known mass in the right mid lung zone.
 2.  New nodullar opacities in the right upper lung zone, not seen on the prior
 radiograph.  This can be further evaluated with CT if clinically indicated.
