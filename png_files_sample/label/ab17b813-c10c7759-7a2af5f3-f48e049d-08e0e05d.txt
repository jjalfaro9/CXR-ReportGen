                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications may be
 slightly less prominent than on the previous study.  This would be consistent
 with some improvement in the pulmonary edema and layering effusions.
