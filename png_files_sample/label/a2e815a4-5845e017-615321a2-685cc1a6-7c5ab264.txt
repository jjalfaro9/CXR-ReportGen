                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with asthma presents with cough and SOB/wheezing eval for PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Pleural thickening at the right
 lung base is chronic and accounts for blunting of the right CP angle.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal contour is unremarkable.  The hila
 appear slightly prominent with increased bronchovascular markings which could
 reflect acute airways inflammation in the setting of asthma.  Difficult to
 exclude a component of central congestion.  No lobar consolidation or large
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild prominence of central bronchovascular markings could reflect acute
 asthma exacerbation and central airways inflammation.  Difficult to exclude
 mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2. Mild cardiomegaly.
