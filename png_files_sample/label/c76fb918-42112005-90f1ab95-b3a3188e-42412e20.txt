                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of breast
 cancer, now with exacerbation of chest pain.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Note is made that the lung
 volumes are very low, exaggerating crowdness of the vessel in the lung bases. 
 Within those limitations small consolidations to suggest infectious process
 are present.  Multiple clips are projecting over the left breast related to
 history of prior left breast surgery.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.
