                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest tightness.  Evaluate for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated but clear.  The heart size is normal. 
 The superior aspect of the right hilus is asymmetrically enlarged, possibly
 secondary to bronchovascular structures versus mild lymphadenopathy.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary process.
 
 2.  Hyperinflated lungs should be correlated to any history of asthma.
 
 3.  Slight asymmetric enlargement of the right hilus, possibly bronchovascular
 structures versus lymphadenopathy.  Recommend bilateral anterior shallow
 oblique radiographs for further evaluation.
 
 Impression point #3 was emailed to the ___ nurse by Dr. ___ on ___.
