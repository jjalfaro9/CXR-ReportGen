 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___, and chest CT performed

 Some of the loculated pleural fluid collection in the right lateral and lower
 chest has been evacuated.  There is new air in that compartment, but no
 generalized pneumothorax.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, marked
 parietal pleural thickening, and right lower lobe atelectasis wall suggest
 that the pleural collection is chronic.  Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis
 has worsened since earlier in the day and there is a new small left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The heart is normal size.  ET tube in
 standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a
 nondistended stomach.
