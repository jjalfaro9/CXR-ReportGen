                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dizziness.  History of congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is again mildly enlarged.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged. There is perhaps a minimal persistent central
 interstitial abnormality but no substantial edema.  Pulmonary edema has almost
 fully resolved.  There is no focal opacity.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Perhaps minimal residual congestive change, but no substantial pulmonary edema
 or evidence of pneumonia.
