                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure s/p trach. Back on
 ventilator. Evaluate change in left lung.  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph from earlier today, left pigtail pleural catheter
 has apparently slightly changed in position, and a small left apical
 pneumothorax is again demonstrated.  Marked interval improved aeration in the
 left mid and lower lung.  .  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by
 the basilar predominant airspace opacities which may be due to asymmetrical
 distribution of edema or  aspiration pneumonia.
