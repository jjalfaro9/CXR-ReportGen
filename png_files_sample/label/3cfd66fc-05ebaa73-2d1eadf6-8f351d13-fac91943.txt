                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening weakness and failure to thrive.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aorta remains mildly tortuous.  Hilar contours are
 normal, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  Rounded opacity within
 the right lung base measuring up to 19 mm is new compared to the prior exam. 
 Left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are
 no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 19 mm rounded opacity within the right lung base could reflect a neoplasm,
 though infection is not excluded.  Further assessment with chest CT is
 recommended.
