                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of asthma with cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate improved lung
 volumes when compared with prior, though they are not hyperexpanded.  There is
 a small airspace opacity posteriorly in the right lower lobe likely due to
 atelectasis. There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature
 is normal.  The heart size is top normal, and apparently increasing compared
 with ___.  The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. No acute chest pathology.
 
 2. Top normal heart size, increasing in size compared with ___. The
 can be physiologic if the patient is pregnant (though we were not alerted to
 that); otherwise increase in heart size warrants evaluation.
 
 These findings were e-mailed to the ED QA nurses.
