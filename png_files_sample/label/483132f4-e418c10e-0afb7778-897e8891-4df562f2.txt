                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with difficulty breathing, pain  // Evaluated for
 pleural effusion, rib fracture
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic
 knob.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  New focal opacity is seen
 within the right lower lobe which may reflect a combination of a small pleural
 effusion and atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis is also noted in the left lung
 base without focal consolidation.  No pneumothorax identified.  The osseous
 structures are diffusely demineralized.  No definite displaced rib fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New focal opacity within the right lower lobe which may reflect a
 combination of a small right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis,
 though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Pulmonary
 infarction or pulmonary contusion are also possibilities, and consider chest
 CTA for further assessment.
 
 2. No definite displaced rib fracture identified.
