                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the nasogastric tube is now in
 place.  It coils within the fundus of the stomach, then proceeds onward to at
 least the mid body of the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the
 image.
 
 There is increased opacification at the right base suggestive of atelectasis
 and effusion.  The left base is slightly clearer than on the previous study.
 
 Extensive metallic devices involving the spine are again seen.
