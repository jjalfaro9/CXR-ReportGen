                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath with cough.  Evaluate for "cpd", infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited by moderate-to-severe S-shaped scoliosis. The
 spine is otherwise not adequately assessed on this study.  Left chest wall
 pacemaker leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is a
 prosthetic aortic valve.  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  There is again elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no
 focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, but no acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality.
