                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adrenal insufficiency, on prednisone with asthma and cough
 and shortness of breath.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Focal ill-defined
 opacity is seen at the right lung base which could represent atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia.  No effusions or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 stable.  Bony structures intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal opacity at the right lung base most likely atelectasis,
 though cannot exclude a tiny focus of pneumonia.
