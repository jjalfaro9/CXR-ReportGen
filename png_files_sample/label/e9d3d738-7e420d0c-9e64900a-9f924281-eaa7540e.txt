                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, now with low oxygen saturation, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again noted is mild hyperinflation of both lungs suggestive of
 underlying emphysema or small airways obstruction.  Mild streaky opacification
 in the right middle lobe decreased on today's examination compared to the
 prior study.  This may represent minimal residual atelectasis, similar to
 prior studies dating back to ___.  The lungs are otherwise relatively
 clear without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, significant
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are within normal limits and unchanged from the prior study.  The visualized
 upper abdomen demonstrates overlying metallic density compatible with a belt
 buckle. Radiopaque densities projecting in the left upper abdomen are
 partially excluded from view on the frontal radiograph and of uncertain
 clinical significance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Minimal
 residual right middle lobe atelectasis.
