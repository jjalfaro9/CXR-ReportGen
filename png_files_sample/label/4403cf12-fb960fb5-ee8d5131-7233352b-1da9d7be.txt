 WET READ VERSION #1

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Mediastinal mass from T-ALL, with chest pain with deep inspiration,
 assess for pneumo, recent failed CVL placement.  Interval change in
 mediastinal mass.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 A right-sided central line is in place, tip over proximal/mid SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is presumably unchanged allowing for
 significant differences in positioning. Though it appears less prominent on
 this exam, though this could be due to the difference between lordotic
 positioning and more conventional AP positioning on the current exam.  An area
 of increased density is seen in the right cardiophrenic region, as well as
 some atelectasis.  These are probably unchanged, but are better seen on
 today's exam due to the differences in positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right central line tip over proximal/mid SVC.
 
 2.  No pneumothorax detected.  If there is continued concern for pneumothorax,
 then a frontal view obtained with the lungs in expiration could help to assess
 for a tiny pneumothorax.
 
 3.  Atelectasis and question additional patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region, similar to the prior film.  This appearance is similar
 to the scout film from the ___ chest CT.  The extensive mediastinal mass seen
 on that CT is otherwise quite subtly represented on this chest x-ray.
