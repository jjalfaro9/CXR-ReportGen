                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate right apical pneumothorax with lateral hydropneumothorax
 component appears similar to the prior study of earlier the same date.  With
 the exception of slight improved aeration at the lung bases, there has been no
 appreciable change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study from
 earlier today.
