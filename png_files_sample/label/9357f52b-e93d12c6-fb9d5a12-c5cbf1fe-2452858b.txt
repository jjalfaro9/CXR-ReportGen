                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 Chest:  Frontal and lateral views
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with leiomyosarcoma receiving chemo and dyspnea  //
 Effusion or pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right Port-A-Cath is again seen all, likely terminating in the low SVC without
 evidence of pneumothorax. At least 2 dominant rounded opacities are again seen
 in the right lung and at least 1 dominant around opacity is seen projecting
 over the left lung, similar in size as compared to the prior study. No new
 focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant change from the prior study.  Multiple bilateral rounded
 nodulew/masses again seen. The appearance of the lungs is similar to prior,
 radiographically, however, CT is more sensitive in detecting small nodules. 
 No pleural effusion or new focal consolidation seen.
