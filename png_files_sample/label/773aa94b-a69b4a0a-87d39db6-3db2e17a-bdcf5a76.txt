                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with acute ischemic stroke, status post
 intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube ends 4.8 cm above the
 carina.  A left chest wall AICD device is seen with leads in the expected
 position of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The NG tube terminates in
 the proximal stomach. The heart is mildly enlarged.  The hilar and mediastinal
 contours, are unremarkable except for mild aortic arch calcification.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is seen. Bibasal opacities likely represent atelectasis. 
 There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Rounded calcific densities
 overlying the right upper abdomen, may represent gallstones or may be external
 to the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina.  Mild
 cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema.
