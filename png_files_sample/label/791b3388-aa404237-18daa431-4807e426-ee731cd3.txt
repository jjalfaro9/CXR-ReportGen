                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with R IJ central line  // Confirm central line
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.
 
 A right-sided internal jugular catheter is seen, terminating in the mid SVC. 
 Left-sided pacemaker is identified.
 
 Probable background hyperinflation.  The cardiac silhouette is probably
 slightly enlarged.   The pulmonary vasculature is somewhat centrally
 congested.  Hazy bilateral opacities are noted.  Lung bases are not entirely
 imaged.  Allowing for this, no frank consolidation is detected.  No gross
 effusions are seen. No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  No obvious
 pneumothorax identified.
 
 Probable COPD.  Mild cardiomegaly.  Vascular congestion with possible hazy
 opacities at the bases.
