                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly decreased compared to the prior exam. Moderate
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette persists. The mediastinal contour is
 unchanged. Calcifications of the aortic knob are again demonstrated. There is
 mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly worse compared to the prior exam.
 Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively noted. There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis.
