                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with respiratory
 insufficiency.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6.3 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular line
 tip is at the level of low SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are grossly
 unchanged.  Mild vascular engorgement is present, but no new focal
 consolidations are differently noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Left basal
 opacity appears to be overall unchanged as compared to the prior study.
