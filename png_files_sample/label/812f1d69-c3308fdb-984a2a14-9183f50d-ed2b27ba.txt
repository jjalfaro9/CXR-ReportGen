                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p open AAA repair, extubated ___  // assess
 volume status      assess volume status
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal to has been
 removed.  There is substantial increase in the opacification involving both
 hemithoraces, consistent with the clinical suspicion of pulmonary edema.  The
 left hemidiaphragm in the retrocardiac region is poorly seen, consistent with
 volume loss in the lower lobe. Hazy opacification bilaterally is consistent
 with layering pleural effusions.
