                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with alcoholic hepatitis with persistent
 hypoxia despite diuresis  // signs of pulmonary edema / effusion (and if
 present how does it compare with prior) vs new acute process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___, mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion
 are persistent findings, accompanied by a mild interstitial edema.  A more
 confluent opacity in the periphery of the left mid lung has increased in the
 interval and is concerning for evolving infectious pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Asymmetrical edema is considered less likely,
 considering the peripheral location.  Severe compression deformity at the
 thoracolumbar junction is unchanged.
