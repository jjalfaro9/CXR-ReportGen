                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AFib  // r/o pna,
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.
 
 There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  Aorta is densely calcified and
 unfolded.  Mitral annulus calcification is noted.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF.
 
 There is blunting of the costophrenic angles posteriorly with evidence for
 small right effusion and tiny left effusion.
 
 Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, but no frank consolidation.
 
 Ill-defined focal density at the right lung base laterally may represent
 artifact due to overlying rib shadows -- attention to this area on followup
 films is requested.
 
 Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation suggestive of COPD.
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  Small right-greater-than-left pleural
 effusions.  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
 
 No CHF or pneumonic infiltrate detected.
 
 Small ill-defined focal density at the right base laterally of uncertain
 etiology or significance -- attention on followup films is requested. 
 Bilateral oblique AP views of the chest may help for further characterization.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  When the patient is stable,  bilateral oblique AP views of
 the chest to further evaluated focal opacity at the right lung base laterally.
