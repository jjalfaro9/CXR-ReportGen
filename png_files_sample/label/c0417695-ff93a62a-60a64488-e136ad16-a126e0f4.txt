                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cirrhosis s/p aspiration  // eval for PNA,
 signs of volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is mildly increased aeration of the left upper lung with near complete
 opacification of the remaining left lung.  The left lower lung cannot be well
 assessed.  Increased focal opacity at the right lung base likely represents
 vascular congestion secondary to volume overload versus redirection of blood
 flow secondary to large left pleural effusion.  A superimposed pneumonia at
 the right lung base cannot be excluded.  A small right pleural effusion is
 noted.
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be assessed due to the large
 left-sided pleural effusion.  A large pneumothorax is not present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Near complete opacification of the left lung has mildly improved with
 increased aeration of the left upper lung.
 2. Vascular congestion at the right lung base may be secondary to volume
 overload versus Re direction of blood flow secondary to large left pleural
 effusion.  A superimposed pneumonia at the right lung base cannot be excluded.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:18 AM, 10 minutes
