                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient with pneumonia and recent seizure for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a subtle streaky opacity overlying the retrocardiac region
 which is likely representative of atelectasis.  Otherwise, the remainder of
 the lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions.  No air is noted under the
 hemidiaphragms.  There are no acute fractures. Mild spurring of the right
 Acromioclavicular joint is noted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Faint retrocardiac opacity which is likely representative of
 atelectasis, though given the history, an area of resolving infection is not
 excluded.
