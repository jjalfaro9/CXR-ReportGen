                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ as well as a CT chest from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dyspnea, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A dialysis
 catheter is unchanged with tip residing in the region of the right atrium. 
 Vague opacity in the left lung base likely represents areas of atelectasis,
 less likely pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  There is no overt evidence for
 edema.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague opacity in the left lower lung could represent atelectasis
 versus pneumonia.
