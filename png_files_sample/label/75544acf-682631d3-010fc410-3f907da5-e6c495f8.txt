                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  Lower extremity edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 normal.  Lung volumes are low but are clear. Pleural surfaces are clear
 without effusion or pneumothorax.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and
 there is no edema.  Punctate calcifications seen diffusely, localized to the
 anterior soft tissues on lateral view, new since prior exam, of unclear
 etiology.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, specifically no evidence of edema or
 vascular congestion.
 2. Punctate calcifications projecting over the anterior soft tissues diffusely
 are new and of unclear etiology, correlate with external artifact/history.
