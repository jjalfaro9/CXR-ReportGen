                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p tracheal stent r/o ptx  // stent placement in
 airway
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, a tracheal and right bronchial
 stents have been placed, with no evidence of significant pneumomediastinum or
 pneumothorax.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for new patchy and linear
 bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis, although aspiration is an additional
 consideration in the post procedural setting.
