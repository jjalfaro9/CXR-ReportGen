 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough and cigarette user.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal.  There is very minimal reticular interstitial
 abnormality in the lower lobes bilaterally that might reflect interstitial
 lung disease.  There is a component of atelectasis in the right lower lobe. 
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 If clinically necessary, high-resolution CT could be performed for further
 assessment of the lung parenchyma.
