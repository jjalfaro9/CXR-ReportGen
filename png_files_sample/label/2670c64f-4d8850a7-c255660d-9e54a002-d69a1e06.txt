  Asymmetric enlargement of the right hilum could be due to vascular structures,
  although lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.  Further evaluation could be
  performed with CT or comparison to old films.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The
 lungs are clear.  The heart size is normal.  There are no pleural effusions. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  Fullness of the right hilar contour is asymmetric
 raising the possibility for lymphadenopathy, although this may just represent
 vascular confluence.  Note is made of elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  No acute cardiac or pulmonary findings.
 
 2.  Asymmetric enlargement of the right hilum could be due to vascular
 structures, although lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.  Further evaluation
 could be performed with CT or comparison to old films is recommended.
