                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 4.7
 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath film.  A
 right-sided central line is present -- the tip is not well seen but appears to
 lie in the region of the SVC/RA junction.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There are bilateral vertical rods and pedicle screws projecting over the upper
 thoracic spine, with overlying skin ___.  
 
  The cardiomediastinal silhouette, which is not fully assessed due to
 rotation, appears unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm and increased retrocardiac density, which could reflect some
 degree of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Calcification
 overlies the left lung apex.Extreme right costophrenic angle excluded from the
 film. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) CHF with interstitial edema, bibasilar atelectasis and possible left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.   Overall, the appearances are similar to
 the film from ___ at 11:29 a.m.  
 
 2) Targeted review of an outside chest CT dated ___ reveals that the left
 upper zone calcifications seen on this exam lie within the left lobe of the
 thyroid.  Clinical correlation required for further assessment.
