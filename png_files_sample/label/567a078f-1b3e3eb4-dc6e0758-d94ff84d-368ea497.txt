                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, chest pain, assess for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The heart is markedly
 enlarged, though this is unchanged.  There is mild pulmonary edema which is
 perhaps slightly increased from prior exam.  There are likely tiny bilateral
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  No definite signs of pneumonia. 
 Mediastinal contour appears stable.  Bony structures are grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, tiny bilateral pleural
 effusions.
