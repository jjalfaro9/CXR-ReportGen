 CHEST RADIOGRAPH, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Enlarging pleural effusion.  Tachycardia.
 
 Preliminary report typed into PACS reads "interval increase in size of
 moderate right pleural effusion.  Patient's known right lung mass with pleural
 extension better assessed on ___ CT.  Left lung is clear."  Signed
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP upright chest radiograph shows large right upper lobe
 perihilar mass with poorly defined borders with the surrounding lung
 parenchyma. There are emphysematous changes at the apices.  Compared to the
 most recent plain film from ___, there is new right pleural
 effusion which also appears increased compared to interim images from CT from
 ___.  No left pleural fluid is present.  The heart and mediastinal
 contours show no suspicious change, and no focal bony lesions are visible.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Moderate- to large-sized right pleural effusion in patient with
 known right lung mass.
