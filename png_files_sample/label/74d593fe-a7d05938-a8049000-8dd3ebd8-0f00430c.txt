                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain; evaluate for dissection.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are multiple air-fluid levels in the right lower hemithorax,
 most likely due to loculated hydropneumothorax.  A consolidation at the right
 base is difficult to exclude.  The left lung is clear.  There is no left
 pleural effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The heart size is at the upper
 limits of normal.  Sternal wires are intact.  Multiple mediastinal clips are
 likely from a prior CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right basilar loculated hydropneumothorax.  A consolidation
 associated with this abnormality is difficult to exclude.
