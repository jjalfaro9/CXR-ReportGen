                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lung volumes are very low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The posterior right hemidiaphragm is obscured on
 the lateral view, suggesting patchy but minor opacity, possibly with a trace
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Suspicion for minor posterior right basilar opacity, not specific but possibly
 compatible with atelectasis; trace pleural effusion is not excluded on the
 right.
