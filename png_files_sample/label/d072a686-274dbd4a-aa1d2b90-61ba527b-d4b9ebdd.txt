                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Diverticulosis, now with GI bleed and low blood pressure. 
 Assess for acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable supine view of the chest was provided.  There is
 irregular opacity at the left lung base which could represent a very early
 pneumonia versus atelectasis/scarring.  The lungs appear lucent in the upper
 lobes, likely reflecting emphysema.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 normal.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the right
 hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle reticular opacities in the left lower lung likely
 represent scarring/atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.  Probable
 underlying emphysema.
