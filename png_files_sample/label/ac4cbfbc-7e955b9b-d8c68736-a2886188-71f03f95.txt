                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fever and productive cough.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Fullness in the left hilus is
 demonstrated, mild but should be further assessed with anterior shallow
 oblique views.  Lungs are essentially clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  Splenomegaly is suspected on the radiograph and might
 be potentially correlated with ultrasound.
