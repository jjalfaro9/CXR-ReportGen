                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with preop for CCY  // evidence of infection
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Diffused increased interstitial markings are most prominent within the left
 lower lobe, in correlate with subpleural fibrosis on the reference CT abdomen
 and pelvis examination.  Increased lung volumes may explain the apparent
 improvement in the diffuse interstitial abnormality, or alternatively, that
 the patient may have been in mild pulmonary edema yesterday. Bilateral hilar
 enlargement may be secondary to lymphadenopathy or dilated pulmonary arteries.
 There is no lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusion. The
 heart size is top-normal. The thoracic aorta is heavily calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased interstitial markings, most significant at the left lung base,
 compatible with fibrotic changes likely secondary to underlying interstitial
 lung disease.  Pulmonary edema improved overnight.
 2. Bilateral hilar prominence, which may be secondary to lymphadenopathy or
 pulmonary arterial enlargement and hypertension.
