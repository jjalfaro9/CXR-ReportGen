                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON: ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax with a
 persistent moderate to large right pneumothorax with apical pneumothorax
 component and basilar hydropneumothorax.  As compared to the recent study, the
 apical pneumothorax component has slightly decreased in size.  Heterogeneous
 opacities in the right lung appear similar.  Postoperative changes in the left
 lung are unchanged in this patient status post previous left upper lobe and
 partial chest wall resection.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema persists
 throughout the right chest wall, both supraclavicular regions, cervical region
 and upper mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right hydropneumothorax has slightly decreased in size at the apex. 
 Otherwise, no relevant short interval change.
