                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE, ___ AT 11 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post tracheoplasty, evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 5:54.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 11 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right internal jugular venous catheter continues to have its tip in
 the proximal right atrium.  A chest tube remains in place.  There continues to
 be extensive subcutaneous emphysema within the soft tissues of the neck as
 well as some air outlining the aortic knob, likely reflecting
 pneumomediastinum.  There has been interval improvement in the superimposed
 pulmonary edema with only residual mild interstitial edema present.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Right-sided rib fractures with associated pleural
 thickening are again seen.  Left basilar, and to a lesser extent, right
 basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.
