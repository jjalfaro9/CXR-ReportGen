                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with effusions, edema  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 13:50
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 05:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There continue to be layering moderate to large pleural effusions, right
 greater than left.  Evaluation of the underlying lung parenchyma is
 challenging, although it does appear to be more consolidative in the
 retrocardiac region suggesting that there is at least left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due
 to marked patient rotation on the current study.  No obvious pulmonary edema
 or pneumothorax.  Right internal jugular central line appears to have its tip
 in the right atrium unchanged.  Left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in
 position.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip projecting over the stomach.  The endotracheal tube has its tip
 approximately 5 mm above the carina and should be pulled back 2-3 cm.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Results were communicated patient's nurse, ___, by phone on
 ___ at 12:37 at the time of discovery.
