                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough, mild shortness of breath and right basilar crackles.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ and CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior studies.  Elevation of the minor fissure, hazy perifissural opacity and
 increased size of the right hilus have all been stable since ___, likely the
 result of prior granulomatous infection also responsible for calcified lymph
 nodes in the right hilus and AP window.  Calcification in the mitral annulus
 and aortic knob are unchanged, but heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
 2.  Hazy opacity surrounding the minor fissure, increased size of right hilus,
 and calcified lymph nodes, stable since ___, likely represent prior
 granulomatous infection without evidence of reactivation.
