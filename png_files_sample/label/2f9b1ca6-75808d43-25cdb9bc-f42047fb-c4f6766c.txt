                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increasing dyspnea and cough for one month.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 very minimal blunting of the bilateral posterior costophrenic angles, which is
 likely not significantly changed from the prior, although very trace pleural
 effusions are not excluded.  Areas of calcification overlying the right
 hemithorax are in similar distribution as compared to the prior, although
 somewhat slightly more prominent as compared to the prior from ___.  No
 definite focal consolidation is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is a
 dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with leads extending to the expected positions
 of the right atrium and right ventricle.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may
 be due to very trace pleural effusions.
 
 Calcifications overlying the right hemithorax are in a similar distribution as
 compared to the prior study, but increased in prominence as compared to
 ___.  Query whether post-surgical.
