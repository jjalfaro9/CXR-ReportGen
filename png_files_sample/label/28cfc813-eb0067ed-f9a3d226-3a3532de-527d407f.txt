 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices remain in standard position except
 an NG tube with tip in the mid thoracic esophagus, as communicated by phone on
 ___ to Dr ___ at 8:25 am at the time of discovery.  Bibasilar lung
 opacities favor atelectasis, and are persistent compared to the prior study. 
 Adjacent small to moderate partially layering pleural effusions are also
 noted, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
