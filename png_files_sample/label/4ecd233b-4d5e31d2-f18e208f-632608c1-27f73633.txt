                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.  Minimal
 vascular congestion. Slight prominence of the right pulmonary hilum is
 relatively unchanged since ___ and is likley due to vascular engorgement. 
 The right costophrenic angle is clear; however, obscuration of the left
 costophrenic angle is likely due to overlying soft tissue.  Underlying trace
 effusion is difficult to exclude.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged. 
 No pneumothorax.  No free air below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal vascular congestion.  Slight prominence of the right
 hilum is similar to the prior study and may be due to vascular engorgement. 
 Evaluation of the left costophrenic angle is limited due to overlying soft
 tissue.  Underlying trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. 
 Cardiomegaly.
