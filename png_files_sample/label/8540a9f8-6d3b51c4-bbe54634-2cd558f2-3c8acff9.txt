                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with muscular dystrophy and MAC bronchiectasis 
 // assess for any radiologic progression      assess for any radiologic
 progression
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.
 
 Upper lungs are clear.  Assessment of the lower lobes is difficult due to
 multiple seal E:  Foci of contamination in the both breasts.  On the lateral
 view no gross abnormality within the lungs demonstrated.  No pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is seen.  Pre size assessment with chest CT justified in this
 patient where the assessment of the chest radiograph is challenged because of
 the superimposed problem.  Potentially there is presence of right upper lobe
 bronchiectasis.
 
 The patient is most likely after bilateral thyroidectomy.
