                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LUL PNA, now decreased breath sounds of L
 lung  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The moderate left pleural effusion has decreased in size. Persistent but
 slightly improved opacification within the left upper lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia, though asymmetric edema or atelectasis are possible. There is
 probably a small to moderate right pleural effusion.  Increased interstitial
 markings at the right base are compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion
 and mild pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval decrease in left pleural effusion, still moderate in size.
 2. Slightly improved persistent opacification of the left upper lobe, which is
 concerning for pneumonia.
 3. Persistent mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary
 edema.
