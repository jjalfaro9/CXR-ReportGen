                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease and asthma presenting with tachypnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The study is limited by exceedingly low lung volumes.  There are
 opacities seen in the left lobe lower lobe.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Cholecystectomy clips and cervical fusion hardware are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes limit full evaluation.  The opacities seen within
 the left lower lobe are likely atelectasis, although, pneumonia is not
 excluded.
