                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.  Blunting
 of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly may be due to chronic pleural
 thickening versus a trace pleural effusion.  Multiple clips are again
 demonstrated within the left breast.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 There are mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  Minimal
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle posteriorly may suggest chronic
 pleural thickening versus trace pleural effusion.
