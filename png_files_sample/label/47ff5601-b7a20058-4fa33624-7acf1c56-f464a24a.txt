                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain, here to evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen with contrast dated ___.  Radiographs of
 the chest performed earlier the same day at 12:16.  Prior chest radiographs
 dated ___ and ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Interstitial lung markings are mildly prominent but stable in comparison to
 prior studies and are likely due to a chronic interstitial abnormality.  No
 focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  There is no pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are prominent likely related to tortuosity
 and unfolding of the thoracic aorta, which is unchanged from prior exams.  The
 patient is status post bilateral total shoulder arthroplasties with stable
 appearance of the prostheses.  Soft tissue density in the posterior
 mediastinum likely corresponds to a moderate-sized hiatal hernia seen on the
 prior CT abdomen.  Several compression fracture deformities of the mid to
 lower thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
 2.  Stable findings of prominent interstitial lung markings, cardiomegaly,
 hiatal hernia and several thoracic vertebral compression fractures.
