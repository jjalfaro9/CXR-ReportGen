                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left effusion, to assess for increased fluid.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in
 the degree of opacification at the left costophrenic angle, consistent with
 recurrent effusion.  Otherwise, no vascular congestion or acute focal
 pneumonia.
 
 Again noted is chronic interposition between the liver and hemidiaphragm.
