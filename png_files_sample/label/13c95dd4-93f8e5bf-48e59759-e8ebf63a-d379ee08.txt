 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema that may be slightly more
 prominent.  Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, with blunting of the

 setting it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
