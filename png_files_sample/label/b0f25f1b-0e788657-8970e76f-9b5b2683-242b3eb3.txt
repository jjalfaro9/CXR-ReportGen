                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. 
 Slight blunting of the right posterior lateral costophrenic sulcus may be due
 to scarring, but a tiny pleural effusion could be considered.  There is no
 evidence for pleural effusion on the left or pneumothorax.  The lung volumes
 are low.  There are streaky opacities at the lung bases, more so on the left
 than right, suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Otherwise, the lungs appear
 clear. Mild degenerative changes are noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Possible trace right-sided pleural effusion versus scarring, and
 streaky basilar opaciites suggesting atelectasis; otherwise unremarkable.
