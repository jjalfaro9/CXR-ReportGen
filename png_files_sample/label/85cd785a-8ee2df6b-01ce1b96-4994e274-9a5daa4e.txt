                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:26 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with acute respiratory distress, history of lung
 cancer, acute desaturation, bilateral chest tubes in place.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Opacification at the base of the left lung is new.  I cannot tell whether this
 is a posteriorly layering pleural effusion or new consolidation. A small left
 pleural catheter may not be in communication with or capable of draining a
 viscous pleural effusion.  There is no left pneumothorax.  The right lung is
 nearly airless.  Large right hilar mass is responsible for widespread
 bronchial obstruction.  Two right pleural drains sitting in a basal
 pneumothorax have cleared some of the previous pleural effusion, but ample
 pleural thickening and loculated fluid remains.  Heart size is indeterminate. 
 Right PIC line ends low in the SVC.  Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these
 findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
