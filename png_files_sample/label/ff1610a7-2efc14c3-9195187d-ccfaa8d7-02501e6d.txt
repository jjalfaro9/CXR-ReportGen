 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with heart failure, here with resp distress  //
 assess interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously severe consolidation in the right mid and lower lung is improving. 
 Lateral view would be helpful to assess the extent of pleural effusion which
 could be considerable, as well as the extent of right lower lobe atelectasis. 
 On the left, there is some pleural fluid, and mild edema. Heart size is
 top-normal, substantially improved since ___. An the cardiac configuration
 suggests substantial left atrial enlargement, although this determination is
 dubious on a bedside chest radiograph.
 
 Overall the findings suggest improving cardiovascular status, and if pneumonia
 was present earlier, it also has improved.
