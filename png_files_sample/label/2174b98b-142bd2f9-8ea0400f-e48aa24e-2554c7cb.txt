 Comparison is made with prior study ___.  
 
 Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are present.  Widened mediastinum is
 unchanged.  There are persistent low lung volumes.  Improved aeration of the
 right lower lobe is consistent with improving atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
