                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  History of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the SVC.  The heart size remains
 mildly enlarged.  The aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged.  The mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Re-
 demonstrated are multiple masses within the right lung, the largest within the
 right upper lobe measuring ___.7 x 2.7 cm on the frontal view.  2 smaller
 lesions are also seen, 1 within the superior segment of the right lower lobe
 measuring 2.7 x 2.0 cm, and 1 within the right middle lobe measuring 5.1 x 3.6
 cm.  Left lateral pleural thickening compatible with extrapleural fat
 deposition is re- demonstrated.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is visualized.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change in multiple masses in the right lung compatible
 with metastatic disease as seen on the prior CT from ___.  No acute
 cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise visualized.
