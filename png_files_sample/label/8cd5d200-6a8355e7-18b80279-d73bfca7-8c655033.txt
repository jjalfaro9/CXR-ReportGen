 HISTORY:  Question aspiration pneumonitis, resolution of prior infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Compared to the prior film, blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again
 noted, unchanged.  The focal opacities in the right mid zone seen on the prior
 film have resolved.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base is again noted,
 but the degree of increased retrocardiac opacity is considerably improved.  No
 CHF.  No new focal infiltrate is detected.  No gross left effusion.  Cardiac
 silhouette is grossly unchanged.
