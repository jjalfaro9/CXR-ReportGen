                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are low lung volumes and basilar atelectasis.  There is
 blunting of at least the right costophrenic angle suggesting a trace pleural
 effusion.  There is also retrocardiac patchy opacity in the lateral view,
 worrisome for consolidation.  The prominence of the hila is stable in this
 patient with known history of hilar lymphadenopathy.  Nodular opacities in the
 lungs, particularly in the left lung and possibly in the right upper lung are
 more conspicuous as compared to the prior study, raising concern for
 progression of disease.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
