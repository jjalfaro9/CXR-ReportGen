                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest, two views.
 CHEST (PA & LAT)
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  There is cardiomegaly.  The aorta is unfolded.  No CHF, focal
 infiltrate, or effusion is identified.  A subtle small right apical
 pneumothorax is present, slightly smaller than on a film obtained earlier at
 8:47 a.m. the same day.  Minimal blunting of right costophrenic angle is again
 noted.  
 
 Multiple fractures, including right posterior third through sixth ribs,
 segmental fractures of 5 and 6, non-displaced fractures of transverse process
 of C6, C7, T1 and T2 are not optimally visualized.
