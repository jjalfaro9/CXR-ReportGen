                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new ET tube.  // Please evaluate location of
 ET tube.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of a new ET tube is seen 3.2 cm above the carina.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Interval removal of previously noted central venous line from
 ___.
 
 There is mild cardiac enlargement with interval increase in mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Increased bibasilar opacities are increased since ___
 with loss of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, which may be due to a combination
 of atelectasis and effusions.  In the right clinical setting, developing
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.   Redemonstrated hardware fusion device in the
 lower cervical and upper thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. The tip of a new ETT is seen 3.2 cm above the carina.
 2. Interval increase in mild vascular congestion and bibasilar opacities,
 likely due to combination of atelectasis and effusion, since ___.
