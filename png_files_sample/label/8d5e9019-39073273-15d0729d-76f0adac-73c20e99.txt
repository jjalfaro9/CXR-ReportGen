                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 Comparison is made with a prior exam dated ___ and ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Anemia, chest pain, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest are provided.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are again noted, moderate on the left and mild on the right.
 Cardiomegaly is suggested, though difficult to assess given effacement of the
 right and left heart borders.  There is central pulmonary congestion.  Lower
 lobe consolidations are also likely present which could reflect atelectasis
 versus pneumonia.  The upper lungs are notable for mild cephalization.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions with lower lobe consolidation, likely
 atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia. Central pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
