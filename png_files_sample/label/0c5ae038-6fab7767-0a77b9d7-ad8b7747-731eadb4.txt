                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison made with prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall with back pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were provided.  The lungs
 appear clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours appear stable.  Calcified
 lymph nodes project over the mediastinum.  The imaged osseous structures are
 intact.  The thoracic spine is poorly assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute injury seen.  If there is strong clinical concern for
 T-spine injury a dedicated thoracic spine radiograph may be performed.
