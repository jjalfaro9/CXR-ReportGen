                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage and intubation,
 now with crackles on lung exam today.
 
 STUDY:  Supine portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip is between the clavicular heads.  The
 endogastric tube courses inferiorly through the expected region of the
 stomach.  The heart size is likely within normal limits, exaggerated by the
 patient's leftward rotation.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are also
 within normal limits.  Again prominent soft tissue density in the right
 superior mediastinal space displaces the normal midline structures towards the
 left; this mass likely represents a goiter.  The lungs demonstrate mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
