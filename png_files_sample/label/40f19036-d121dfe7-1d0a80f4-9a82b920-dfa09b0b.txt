                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Coffee ground emesis.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is normal.  The aortic knob is minimally calcified.  Mediastinal
 and hilar contours are unchanged.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal. 
 Patchy opacity within the right lung base may reflect atelectasis though
 aspiration is not excluded.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Degenerative changes are again
 noted within the lower thoracic spine.  Remote right rib fracture is
 re-demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis but aspiration is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.
