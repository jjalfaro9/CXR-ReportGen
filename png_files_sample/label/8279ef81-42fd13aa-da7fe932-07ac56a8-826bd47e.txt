                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and prior studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina with the
 neck in a flexed position, and a feeding tube terminates within the proximal
 stomach.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Recently
 described biapical opacities have improved, with residual opacities likely
 representing baseline pleural and parenchymal scarring with adjacent bullae as
 demonstrated on the ___ chest radiograph.  Left retrocardiac opacity has
 slightly improved, and may represent a combination of atelectasis and
 effusion.
