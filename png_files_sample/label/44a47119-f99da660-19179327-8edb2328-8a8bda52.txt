 is seen.  Re- demonstration of complete opacification of left hemithorax is
 seen when compared with previous same-day study.  Increase of the leftward
 mediastinal shift following thoracentesis and small pneumothorax is suggestive
 of complete left lung collapse along with pleural effusion and tumor. 
 Multiple right lung nodules are again seen and unchanged consistent with
 metastatic disease.  Left bronchial stent is seen again and unchanged in
 position.
