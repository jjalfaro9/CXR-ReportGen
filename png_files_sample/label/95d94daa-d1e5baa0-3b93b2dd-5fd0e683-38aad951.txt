                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumonia, ARDS, right lung collapse, interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___ and
 chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube is in adequate position and NG tube ends below the diaphragm.  Right
 lower lung collapse is unchanged.  Left lower lung opacities that were
 increased in yesterday x-ray compared to ___ have slightly improved,
 part of it could be from layering pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Cardiac contour is hard to assess throughout the lung abnormality.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged severe left lower lung collapse.
 2.  Improvement of left lower lung opacities which could partly be explained
 by layering pleural effusion.
