                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased oxygen requirement, s/p VATS wedge
 resection  // Evaluation of pulm edema, consolidations
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 09:41 hand allowing for differences in
 technique, there has been slight clearing of the alveolar opacities in both
 lungs, suggesting improving CHF. Considerable CHF remains present . The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged. Clips and relative
 lucency at the left upper lung are again seen. No well-defined pneumothorax is
 identified, but the possibility of a trace residual pneumothorax would be
 difficult to exclude. No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in CHF findings.  No obvious pneumothorax.
