                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at outside institution.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are streaky bilateral perihilar opacities, likely involving the right
 middle lobe, lingula, and lower lobes.  Findings may be due to atypical
 infection and/or related to mild edema.  Again seen are 2 calcified rounded
 subcentimeter opacities projecting over the right lung apex which most likely
 represent calcified granuloma.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.  The
 mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
