                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with endotracheal tube, questionable pneumonia,
 and collapsed left lower lobe.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and right PICC line are in satisfactory
 position.  Left lower lobe collapse persists.  Heterogeneous opacification of
 the right lung base has improved since the prior study, which may reflect
 redistribution of right pleural effusion secondary to upright position.  The
 underlying heterogeneous parenchymal abnormality remains and is persistently
 concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Slightly different appearance of the right lower lobe secondary to patient
 positioning and redistribution of the right pleural effusion.
 2.  Persistent left lower lobe collapse.
 3.  Heterogeneous right basilar opacity distal concerning for pneumonia.
