                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cough, elevated HR, and fever, s/p
 ileocecectomy POD 4.  // PNA      PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is increased
 opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac region medially, most
 likely reflecting volume loss in the left lower lobe.  The hemidiaphragm is
 not as sharply seen, raising the possibility of some associated pleural fluid.
 Superimposed pneumonia is less likely, though it would be difficult to
 unequivocally eliminate this possibility in the appropriate clinical setting.
