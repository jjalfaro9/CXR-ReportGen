                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with cough for days  // ? infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   On the frontal view only, there
 is very subtle right infrahilar opacity which could represent crowded
 bronchovascular markings though the possibility of a very early pneumonia is
 impossible to exclude. Otherwise lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous
 structures are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible early consolidation in the right infrahilar region.
