                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and is accompanied by pulmonary
 vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema, the latter likely
 superimposed upon chronic underlying lung disease.  Left hilum appears
 enlarged, with adjacent geographically marginated opacities which may
 correspond to previous history of radiation therapy for advanced lung cancer. 
 Bilateral small pleural effusions appear similar to the prior radiograph as
 well as left apicolateral pleural thickening.
 
 Consider a dedicated chest CT for more complete evaluation of the left hilar
 region to monitor the patient's lung cancer, particularly in the absence of
 more remote comparison radiographs.
