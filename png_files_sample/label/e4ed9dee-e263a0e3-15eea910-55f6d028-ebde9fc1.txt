                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for acute process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided hemodialysis catheter is seen to terminate in the right
 atrium.  Lung volumes are low in volume with mild vascular congestion.  Linear
 left mid lung opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is prominent but likely due to low lung volumes.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular congestion without overt edema.
