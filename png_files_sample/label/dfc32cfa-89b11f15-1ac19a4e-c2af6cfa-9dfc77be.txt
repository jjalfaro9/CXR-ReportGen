                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now terminating 4.4 cm above the carina. 
 Multifocal lung opacities appear similar except for slight worsening at the
 right lung base.  Otherwise, no relevant short-interval changes since recent
 study of a few hours earlier.
