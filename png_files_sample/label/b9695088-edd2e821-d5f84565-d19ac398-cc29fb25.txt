                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension.  Right upper quadrant pain and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The previously noted hazy pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
 effusions have largely resolved although small residual effusions remain
 present.  There is hyperexpansion which has been noted on multiple prior
 exams.  Similarly, there is a stable severe levoconcave scoliosis of the
 thoracic spine.  Overall the lung markings are relatively stable compared to
 numerous exams, likely indicating baseline.  There may be hazy atelectasis at
 the right lung base.  Numerous clips again project in the left perihilar
 region.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax seen.  Air is noted within the esophagus which has been seen on
 multiple prior exams as well.  Deformities of posterior left ribs indicate
 healed trauma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Numerous abnormalities however relatively stable across multiple
 prior examinations likely demonstrating return to baseline for this patient. 
 There are ill-defined opacities in right lower lobe again which have been
 noted on prior studies.  It is difficult to entirely exclude an early
 developing infiltrate however again this patient is most likely at baseline. 
 If clinical suspicion remains high, consider short interval repeat to help
 establish the stability.
