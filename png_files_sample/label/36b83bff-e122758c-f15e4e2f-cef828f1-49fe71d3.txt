 FINDINGS:
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. 
 Moderate hiatal hernia is demonstrated.  Hilar contours are normal.  There is
 no pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. 
 Multiple compression deformities are noted within the mid thoracic spine and
 at the thoracolumbar junction, of unknown chronicity.

 Patchy bibasilar atelectasis.  Moderate size hiatal hernia.  Compression
 deformities within the mid thoracic spine and at the thoracolumbar junction,
 age indeterminate.
