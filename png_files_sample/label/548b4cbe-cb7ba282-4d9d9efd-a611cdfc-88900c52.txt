                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The study was
 made available for my interpretation, today, ___, at 11:25 a.m.
 There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates
 approximately 5.3 cm above the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube has also
 been placed in the interval, with side port at the level of the GE junction,
 but with distal tip not included in the image and likely coursing through the
 proximal stomach.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Lungs are clear without focal
 consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Nasogastric tube side port at the GE junction; however, on followup
 imaging on ___, it was in the expected location of the stomach.
