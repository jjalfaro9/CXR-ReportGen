                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with fall; headstrike. has hx of subdural and fractures.  //
 eval for fx, bleed
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent streaky left basilar opacity, similar is configuration
 when compared to prior.  This may be due to atelectasis versus scarring given
 persistence since prior. The lungs are hyperinflated with no new
 consolidation. Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles may be due to
 atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Left chest wall dual lead pacing
 device again noted. Compression deformities in the lower thoracic spine were
 seen on prior CT Rounded opacity at the right ventrolateral aspect of the T5
 vertebral body is more completely characterized on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change. Left basilar opacity most likely due to
 atelectasis versus scarring. Blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles
 potentially atelectasis or small effusions.
