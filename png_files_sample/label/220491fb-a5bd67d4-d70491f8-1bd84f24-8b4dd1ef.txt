 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis and SOB  // INTERVAL CHANGES,

 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right-sided PICC line is unchanged in position.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  There is again seen an opacity at the right base
 which is most consistent with atelectasis however early infiltrate would be
 difficult to exclude.  Minimal atelectasis at the left base is seen.  There
 are no pneumothoraces or signs for overt pulmonary edema.
