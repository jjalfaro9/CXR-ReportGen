                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, after chest tube removal.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with earlier the same day, a chest tube at the left lung base has
 been removed.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Again noted is a right IJ
 sheath over the proximal-most SVC and a right subclavian central line with tip
 in region of SVC-RA junction, unchanged.
 
 Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  Left base collapse and/or consolidation is stable.Small
 left pleural effusion is unchanged.   There is also some increased opacity at
 the right base, with a small right effusion, which may be slightly worse. 
 There is upper zone redistribution.  I doubt overt CHF. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Interval removal of left chest tube.  No new pneumothorax or increase in
 left-sided effusion.  
 
 2) Equivocal slight increase in opacity at right base.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.
