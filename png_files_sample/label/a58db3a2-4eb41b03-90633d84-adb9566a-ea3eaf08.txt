 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post parastomal hernia repair, evaluation for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal
 improvement in transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  In the
 interval, the patient has been extubated.  However, signs of minimal pulmonary
 edema persist.  The nasogastric tube is in unchanged position.  The two
 central venous access lines are constant.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No evidence
 of larger pleural effusions.
