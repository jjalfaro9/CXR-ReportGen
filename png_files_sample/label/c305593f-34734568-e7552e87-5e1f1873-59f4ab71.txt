                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 No prior studies for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  A poorly defined 2.5 cm diameter nodule is present anteriorly in
 the right upper lobe, accompanied by possible right paratracheal and right
 hilar lymph node enlargement.  A nonspecific opacity is also identified in the
 right infrahilar region, difficult to fully characterize due to summation of
 structures in this region.  Heart size is normal.  Aorta is diffusely
 calcified.  Lungs are hyperexpanded.  No pleural effusion.  Bones are
 diffusely demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right upper lobe lung nodule with possible adjacent mediastinal
 and hilar lymphadenopathy.  Given the clinical history of suspicious bone
 lesion, observed findings are most concerning for primary lung cancer. 
 Further evaluation with dedicated chest CT is recommended.  
 
 Dr. ___ was telephoned with this finding and recommendation at 9 a.m. on
 ___ at the time of discovery.  This information has also been
