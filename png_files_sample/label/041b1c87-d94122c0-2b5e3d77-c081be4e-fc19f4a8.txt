 interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable. Probable small layering effusions, left
 greater than right.

 Endotracheal tube with its tip at the thoracic inlet.  Interval placement of a
 nasogastric tube with the tip coursing below the diaphragm and the tip not
