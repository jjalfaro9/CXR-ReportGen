                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Scout view from CT torso from ___ and ___
 as well as chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is top-normal.  Slight prominence of the lower right
 peritracheal soft tissue is similar in appearance to the prior chest CT scout
 images and more likely relates to vascular structure as opposed to
 lymphadenopathy.  Subtle streaky left basilar opacity is seen right,
 retrocardiac which may be due to atelectasis although an early infectious
 process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema is seen.
