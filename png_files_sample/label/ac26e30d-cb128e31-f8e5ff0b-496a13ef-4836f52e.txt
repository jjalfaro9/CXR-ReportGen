                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hospital-acquired pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain essentially unchanged.  There is evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the
 bases.  Retrocardiac opacification most likely reflects volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.
