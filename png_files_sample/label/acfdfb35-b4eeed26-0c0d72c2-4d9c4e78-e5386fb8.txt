                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Feeling unwell, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate top normal
 heart size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Calcified plaques are noted along the bilateral diaphragms with
 calcified areas projecting over the left hemithorax likely also reflecting
 calcified pleural plaques.  One more rounded area projecting over the eighth
 posterior rib on the left may represent an additional calcified pleural
 plaque, although a pulmonary nodule is possible.  No focal consolidation.
 Multilevel mild compression deformities are noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumonia.
 
 2.  Calcified pleural plaques, likely related to prior asbestos exposure.
 
 3.  Small rounded opacity projecting over the left eighth posterior rib may
 represent a calcified pleural plaque, although a pulmonary nodule is possible.
 If prior studies exist for comparison, this would be helpful, otherwise
 recommend further evaluation with non-emergent chest CT.
