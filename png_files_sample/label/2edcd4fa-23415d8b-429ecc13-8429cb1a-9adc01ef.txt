                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, chest pain, and history of congestive heart
 failure.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is again moderate-to-severely enlarged.  There is mild
 widening of the vascular pedicle, suggesting fluid overload, somewhat
 increased.  There is mildly prominent pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild
 congestion.  Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.  There are no definite pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax.  The lateral view, in particular, is limited by
 soft tissue attenuation but there are similar small osteophytes and minimal
 wedging among several lower thoracic vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
