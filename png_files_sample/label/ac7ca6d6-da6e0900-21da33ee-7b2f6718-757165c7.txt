                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right pigtail pleural catheter.  Assess
 for change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 805.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacer is unchanged in position.  A right pigtail catheter
 remains in place, and there has been interval decrease in right basilar
 opacity suggesting a decreasing pleural effusion.  There is a bibasilar patchy
 opacity as well as a small left effusion, likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis. Lung volumes do remain low, and there is crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature.  Overall, the vascular congestion appears slightly
 worse than on the prior study of ___ but improved from ___.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess due to marked patient's rotation on the current
 examination and the markedly low lung volumes.  However, the heart is likely
 stably enlarged.
