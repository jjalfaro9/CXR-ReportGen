 AP CHEST, 6:34 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with newly placed NG tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 6:43 a.m.
 
 Newly placed nasogastric tube ends in the stomach but would need to be

 junction.  Right jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema worsened since earlier in the day,
 following tracheal extubation.  Bilateral infrahilar consolidation could be
 atelectasis, pneumonia or combination of either with dependent pulmonary
 edema.  The finding worsened appreciably between ___ and ___ and
 has not subsequently improved.  Moderate cardiomegaly is also stable.
