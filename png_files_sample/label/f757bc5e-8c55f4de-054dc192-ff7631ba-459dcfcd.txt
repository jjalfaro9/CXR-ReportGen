  retrocardiac opacity may be atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with inferolateral STEMI, complaining of pleuritic chest
 pain, evaluation for any consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:
 
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since previous exam there is increased interstitial marking compatible with
 moderate interstitial edema.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged
 with mild cardiomegaly.  Bilateral pleural effusions are new and small.  Left
 lower lung opacities are mostly compatible with atelectasis.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 This patient was already investigated by a CT scan in ___ for multiple
 bilateral nodularity that are chronic and most prominent in the right upper
 lobe.  Those changes are partly obscured today by pulmonary edema.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 New pulmonary edema is moderate.
