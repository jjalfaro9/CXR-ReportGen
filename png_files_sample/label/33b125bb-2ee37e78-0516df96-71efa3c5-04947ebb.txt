                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with vol overload  // any change in infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray examination from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is likely present, its tip is obscured by the spinal fixation
 hardware.  It does not extend to or beyond the carina.
 
 A left subclavian PICC line is present, tip probably overlies the right
 atrium.  A right IJ central line is present, tip near SVC/ RA junction. 
 Linear densities seen over lower mediastinum and upper abdomen could represent
 an NG tube --___ so extends beneath the diaphragm , off the film.  Extensive
 bilateral posterior spinal fixation hardware is noted.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent,
 but unchanged.  There is vascular plethora, consistent with CHF.  There is
 atelectasis at both lung bases.  The possibility of an early pneumonic
 infiltrate in this area is difficult to exclude.  Small bilateral effusions
 are likely present.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  Allowing for this, there is prominence of vascular
 markings with vascular blurring consistent with CHF and interstitial edema. 
 This has progressed compared with ___.  Small bilateral effusions
 are probably also slightly more pronounced.
 
 Bibasilar atelectasis.  In this setting, an early pneumonic infiltrate would
 be difficult to exclude.
