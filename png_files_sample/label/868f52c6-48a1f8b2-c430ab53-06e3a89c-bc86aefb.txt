                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 17:12
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with right hemothorax.  CT placed to
 suction.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 7:11.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 17:12 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right chest tube remains in place.  There are persistent low lung volumes
 with a more elliptical opacity in the right mid lung likely representing
 loculated fluid/blood within the horizontal fissure.  Superimposed pneumonia
 and/or atelectasis should also be considered.  The left lung remains clear. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Possible small right
 apical pneumothorax as there appears to be a curvilinear line projecting above
 the right third rib.  The discrepancy between the wet reading and the final
 reading has been called to the patient's nurse, ___ on ___ at 8:50
 a.m.  Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Low lung volumes. 
 Left lung is grossly clear.  The left costophrenic angle is not entirely
 included on this study.
