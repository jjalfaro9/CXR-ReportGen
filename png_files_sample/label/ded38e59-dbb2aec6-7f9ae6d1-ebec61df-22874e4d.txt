                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with first rib resection and prior tachycardia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from ___.
 
 The right-sided chest tube has migrated more proximally and the tip is just
 beyond the chest wall.  This could be readjusted for more optimal placement. 
 There are no pneumothoraces identified.  There is some atelectasis at the lung
 bases, unchanged.  Postoperative changes of the right first rib are again
 seen.  There are no signs for pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.
