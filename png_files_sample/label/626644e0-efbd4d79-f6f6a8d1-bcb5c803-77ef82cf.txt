                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with HIV, left heel ulcer with osteomyelitis,
 presents with chills, shaking concerning for rigors.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly appears slightly increased in size compared to
 the prior study.  Moderate pulmonary edema is substantially worse in the
 interval with moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
 than left.  Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the right, likely
 reflect areas of compressive atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening moderate pulmonary edema with new moderate to large bilateral
 pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection at the lung bases
 cannot be excluded.
