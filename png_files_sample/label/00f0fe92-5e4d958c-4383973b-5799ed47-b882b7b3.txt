 There is somewhat widened appearance of the mediastinum, which may be due to
 tortuous thoracic aorta and enlargement of the right hilum.  The lung volumes
 are low, carotid in the pulmonary vasculature.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear
 there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Gaseous distension
