                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Chest pain, minor shortness of breath, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are provided.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged.  Underpenetrated technique limits evaluation for mild
 pulmonary edema and therefore mild edema is difficult to exclude.  No large
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The mediastinal contour is prominent, which
 could reflect vascular ectasia with slight leftward deviation of the trachea
 which is stable and may reflect thyroid enlargement.  Bony structures are
 intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly with possible mild pulmonary interstitial
 edema.  Prominence of the mediastinum is stable and may reflect vascular
 ectasia or possible thyroid enlargement.
