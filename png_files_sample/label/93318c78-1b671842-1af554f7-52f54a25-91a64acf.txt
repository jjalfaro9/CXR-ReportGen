                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and
 no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.  Right apical pleural and parenchymal
 abnormalities again seen, most likely related to previous infection and
 scarring.
 
 Continued hyperinflation of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary
 disease.  No vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
