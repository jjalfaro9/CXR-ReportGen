                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  CAD, CHF, severe aortic regurgitation with aortic root and
 valve repair in ___.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.  Right PICC tip is in
 the upper-to-mid SVC.  Moderate pulmonary edema has improved. 
 Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has minimally decreased allowing the
 difference in positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar opacities larger on the
 right side are consistent with atelectasis.  Left perihilar plate-like
 atelectases have improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  Sternal wires are
 aligned.
