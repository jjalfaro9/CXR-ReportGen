                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Bibasilar crackles.  Question pneumonia or pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is persistent retrocardiac opacity obscuring the
 medial left hemidiaphragm, although it appears less extensive than on the
 prior study, comparing the lateral views.  The shape of the residual opacity
 is convex on the lateral view.  Background prominence of interstitial markings
 is somewhat improved suggesting improvement in vascular congestion.  Marked
 hyperinflation is similar.  Bony demineralization and loss in vertebral body
 heights along the lower thoracic spine appear similar.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving left lower lobe opacity with a substantial residual
 convex opacity, however.  
 
 Differential considerations include round atelectasis or loculated pleural
 effusion.  A mass is also not possible to exclude at this site, however.  
 
 Depending on clinical circumstances, continued radiographic surveillance could
 be considered to show resolution or alternatively the opacity could be
 evaluated with chest CT, preferably with intravenous contrast if possible,
 when clinically appropriate.
