                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The
 heart is normal in size.  The aortic arch is calcified.  The chest is
 hyperinflated.  Trace pleural effusions are suspected.  There is also a patchy
 new left basilar opacity predominantly in the left lower lobe.  Subpleural
 thickening at each lung apex appears stable.  Bilateral nipple shadows are
 visualized.  The bones are probably demineralized and degenerative changes and
 mild loss among lower thoracic vertebral body heights is unchanged. 
 Mild-to-moderate S-shaped spinal curvature is also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
