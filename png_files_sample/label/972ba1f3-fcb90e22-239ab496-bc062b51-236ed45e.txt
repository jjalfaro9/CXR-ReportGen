                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with paroxysmal atrial
 fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, treated with
 amiodarone; assessment for amiodarone lung toxicity.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size is substantially enlarged, even more pronounced than on the prior
 study.  Mediastinum is stable.  Lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no interval
 development of interstitial abnormality to suggest interval development of
 amiodarone lung toxicity within the limitations of this study technique. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Substantial scoliosis is noted
 with right convexity.
