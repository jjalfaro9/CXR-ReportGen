                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman intubated in the ICU.  Evaluate ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, previously large, continues to
 recede, there may be new peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe,
 a finding concerning for early pneumonia or recent aspiration.  Unfortunately,
 external devices overlie the region.  I would recommend repeat chest
 radiograph later in the day, with careful attention paid to removing visual
 distractions.
 
 Left lung is grossly clear and there is no appreciable left pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is just above the upper margin of the clavicles,
 no less than 7 cm from the carina and should be advanced at least 3 cm to
 improve aeration and prevent extubation.
 
 Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Right
 jugular dialysis catheters end low in the SVC, right jugular line ends just
 above the junction of brachiocephalic veins.  There is no pneumothorax.
