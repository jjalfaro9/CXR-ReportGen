                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post fall, rule out fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were performed.  There is no
 pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal airspace consolidation.  The cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged, accounting for differences in technique.  The
 mediastinal contours and hilar structures are unremarkable.  There is no
 displaced rib fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No rib fracture.  If concern for rib fracture persists, a
 dedicated rib series with markers would be helpful.
