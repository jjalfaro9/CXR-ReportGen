                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, esophageal cancer, left transudative pleural
 effusion with Pleurx catheter.  Assess for pneumonia, pneumothorax or
 reaccumulation of fluid.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates stable right pleural
 effusion with ovoid opacity projecting over mid lung likely representing
 loculated pleural fluid within the fissure.  Unchanged right basilar
 opacification likely reflects atelectasis given chronicity though cannot
 exclude superimposed infectious process.  Increased central pulmonary vascular
 engorgement suggesting pulmonary edema.  Increased nodular opacifications
 within the right upper lung may represent multifocal infectious process
 possibly aspiration though assymetric pulmonary edema is a consideration.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Redemonstration of esophageal
 stent in stable position.  Left Port-A-Cath terminates within the right
 atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable right pleural effusion with intrafissural component.
 2.  On a background of new pulmonary edema, there is stable right lower lung
 opacification.  Opacification may represent combination of atelectasis and
 effusion; however, given new right upper lung multifocal opacification,
 infectious process and/or aspiration are considerations.
