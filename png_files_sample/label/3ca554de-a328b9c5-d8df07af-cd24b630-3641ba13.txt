                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pulmonary vasculature is
 not engorged.  Increased interstitial markings with patchy opacities at the
 lung bases persist, most likely reflective of a combination of known chronic
 interstitial lung disease with atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are mild to moderate multilevel
 degenerative changes demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with chronic interstitial abnormality and likely superimposed
 atelectasis at the lung bases.
