                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___, and a more recent study from
 ___ although the latter is not available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  Patchy left basilar opacity is most suggestive of
 minor atelectasis.  There is a lenticular opacity projecting over the left
 lower posterior hemithorax, which is probably associated with the left
 posterior hemithorax and although not specific, its shape is suggestive of a
 new loculated pleural effusion.  Other etiologies such as pneumonia or
 pulmonary mass are not excluded by this study, however, and investigation with
 chest CT should be considered when clinically appropriate.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left posterior opacity, smooth and lenticular, suggesting there
 may be a loculated effusion, although other etiologies including a pulmonary
 mass cannot be excluded.  Assessment with chest CT is suggested when
 clinically appropriate.
