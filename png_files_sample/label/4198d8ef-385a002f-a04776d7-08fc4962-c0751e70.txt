                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with questionable aspiration event.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of
 endotracheal tube which terminates 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. 
 There is also a new feeding tube which projects over the expected course of
 the esophagus and enters the stomach with side port below the gastroesophageal
 junction.  The lung volumes are low, and could account for the relative
 increase in opacification of the right lower lung due to vascular crowding. 
 The heart size is difficult to assess due to low lung volumes but is not
 significantly changed since the prior study.  There is no pneumothorax or
 large pleural effusion.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Opacification of the right lower lung could be completely
 explained by low lung volumes causing vascular crowding.  Endotracheal tube
 and feeding tube in standard position.
