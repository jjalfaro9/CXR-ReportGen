                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough in a patient with heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  A new left pectoral defibrillator is seen with its leads ending
 in the right ventricle.  Median sternotomy wires are intact and well aligned. 
 Unchanged linear opacities in the left lower lung most likely represent
 atelectasis; otherwise, the lungs are clear without evidence of pulmonary
 edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Aortic calcifications and
 moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly are unchanged.  There are no concerning
 osseous or soft tissue lesions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 2.  Left lower lobe atelectasis and moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly are
 unchanged.
