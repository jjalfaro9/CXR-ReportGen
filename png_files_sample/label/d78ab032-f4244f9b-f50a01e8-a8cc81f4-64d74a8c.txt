                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Bilateral pain in both humeral bones.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to prior studies, in
 particular with recent prior study from ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly with predominantly enlarged left ventricle is unchanged. 
 Mediastinal silhouette is stable with dilatation of the right upper
 mediastinum vessels.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 seen.
 
 Lateral view demonstrates extensive calcification of the coronary arteries  .
 
 Note is made that this study neither exclude nor confirm the presence of
 aortic dissection and suspected, correlation with CT of the chest should be
 considered.
