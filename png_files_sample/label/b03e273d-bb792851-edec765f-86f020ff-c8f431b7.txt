                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Increasing shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms,
 suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  There is slight blunting of
 the bilateral costophrenic angles, which may be due to pleural thickening
 although very trace pleural effusions are not excluded.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 is seen, without definite focal consolidation.  Relative lucency at the upper
 lungs likely relates to pulmonary emphysema.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  COPD and findings suggesting pulmonary emphysema.  Slight
 blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to pleural
 thickening, although trace effusions are not excluded.  Bibasilar opacities
 most likely represent atelectasis; however, an early infectious process is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
