                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cough and fever.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two views of the chest again demonstrate increased retrocardiac
 opacity silhouetting the descending thoracic aorta.   Unfolding of the aorta
 is noted.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe consolidation compatible with pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical setting. Suggest repeat after treatment to document
 resolution.
