                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pacemaker placement  // Eval for lead
 position and pneumothorax      Eval for lead position and pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better
 inspiration.  The left subclavian pacer remains in place with leads extending
 to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
 Continued mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The pulmonary vessels
 are less well distinct, suggesting some increase in the degree of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacification obscures the hemidiaphragms,
 consistent with the substantial pleural effusions seen on the lateral view. 
 Underlying compressive atelectasis is seen bilaterally, especially in the left
 lower lobe.
