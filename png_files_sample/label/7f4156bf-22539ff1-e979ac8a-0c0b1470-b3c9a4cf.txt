                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with cough.
 
 COMPARISON: PA & lateral chest radiographs of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS: The patient's neck is flexed and head obstructs portions of the
 apical lung regions and anterior mediastinum.  There is severe new
 cardiomegaly with no clear evidence of failure.  Left-sided pacer is seen with
 leads terminating within the right atrium and right ventricle with no obvious
 complications.  There are apparent peripheral interstitial reticular opacities
 which could reflect chronic scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax. The aorta is mildly calcified.
 
 Seen on the left side are at least two contiguous rib fractures (approximately
 the ___ and ___ lateral rib level) with an adjacent well-demarcated opacity
 with incomplete borders, which could represent either a pleural or an
 extrapleural mass. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1)  Left rib fractures with adjacent opacity concerning for either pleural or
 extrapleural mass.  In the context of melanoma, this finding raises the
 concern for possible metastasis.  CT or dedicated rib series may be considered
 if warranted clinically. 
 2)  Marked cardiomegaly with no evidence of acute CHF.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:25 p.m. via
 ___ as requested by the ordering physician.
