                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatic cancer, fever.  On chemotherapy.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal
 limits.  Streaky opacities within the lung bases bilaterally appear more
 progressed from the prior study, and likely reflect atelectasis.  Infection,
 particularly in the left lung base, cannot be completely excluded.  Small left
 pleural effusion appears not significantly changed in the interval.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Multiple clips are demonstrated within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent small left pleural effusion.  Worsening bibasilar airspace
 opacities, likely reflecting atelectasis though infection within the left lung
 base cannot be completely excluded.
