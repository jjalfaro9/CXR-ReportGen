                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Cough and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Lung volumes are
 low. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is new retrocardiac
 opacification which is fairly streaky in nature. Elsewhere, the lungs remain
 clear. There is very mild S shaped curvature to the visualized thoracolumbar
 spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left lower lobe opacity with morphology more suggestive of atelectasis
 than pneumonia although infection of lower airways or bronchopneumonia is not
 excluded.
