                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of pulmonary
 vascular congestion has decreased.  There is still huge enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Opacification at the left base and retrocardiac region is
 again consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 The monitoring and support devices appear to be essentially unchanged.
