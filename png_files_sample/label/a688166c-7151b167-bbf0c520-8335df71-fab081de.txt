                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of breast cancer and malignant effusion, presenting with
 fever and hypoxia to ___%.  Assess for pleural effusion and/or pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. 
 Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are increased compared to the
 prior study from ___.  Consolidative opacities at both lung bases
 likely reflect compressive atelectasis and pleural effusions, although
 concomitant infection at either lung base is certainly possible.  There is
 engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema.  Background emphysematous changes are redemonstrated.  The heart size
 is top normal.  The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, as before.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe
 consolidative opacities, likely compressive atelectasis given the adjacent
 effusions, although infection at either lung base is certainly possible.
 2.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
