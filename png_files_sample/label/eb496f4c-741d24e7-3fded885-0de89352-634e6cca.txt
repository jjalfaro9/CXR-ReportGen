                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bedridden with white blood cell count of 35, question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP semi-upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 There are low lung volumes, though allowing for this, the lungs are clear
 bilaterally with no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  A small
 calcified granuloma in the right lower lung is re-demonstrated with a stable
 appearance.  There is no evidence of CHF.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 normal.  Fixation hardware is noted in the lower C-spine.  Bony structures
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.
