                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with generalized weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Lung volumes are low,
 exaggerating heart size and pulmonary vascular prominence.  It is difficult to
 exclude underlying pulmonary vascular congestion.  Evaluation of the lung
 bases is suboptimal in the setting of low lung volumes.  Right basilar opacity
 could be seen with atelectasis associated with elevated right hemidiaphragm. 
 Aortic calcifications are again noted.  Sternal wires are seen.  Left
 subclavian line terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction/high right
 atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Right basilar opacity is most likely atelectasis, but infection
 cannot be entirely excluded.  These findings were discussed with Dr. ___
 ___ by Dr. ___ by telephone at 10:03 p.m. on ___.
