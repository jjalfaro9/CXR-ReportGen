                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypertensive urgency in the postpartum period and the
 pain in her back between the shoulders, suspected aortic dissection.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear and there is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Normal chest radiograph.  Note is made that this study neither
 confirms nor excludes the possibility of aortic dissection in appropriate
 clinical context and if clinically warranted, correlation with CT angiography
 should be performed.
