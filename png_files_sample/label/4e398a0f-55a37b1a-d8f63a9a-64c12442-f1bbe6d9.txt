 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube remains in place, with persistent small right
 apical hydropneumothorax.  Surgical clips are again demonstrated consistent
 with wedge resection site.  Slight worsening of heterogeneous opacities in
 right lung, which may reflect asymmetrical edema or infection.  Small
 dependent pleural effusions are similar, right greater than left.
