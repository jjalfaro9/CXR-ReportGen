                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with AMS  // evidence of pneumonia      evidence of
 pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Evaluation of the chest is limited due to patient rotation. The inspiratory
 lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and
 accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. An airspace opacity in the
 right lung base is new from the prior study and may represent a focus of
 infection. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. There is
 moderate levoconvex curvature of the thoracolumbar spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A new airspace opacity in the right lung base may represent a focus of
 infection.
