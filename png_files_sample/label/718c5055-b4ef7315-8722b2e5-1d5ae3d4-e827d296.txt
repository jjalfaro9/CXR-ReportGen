                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with new NG tube, assess placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ from earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Sequential portable chest radiographs were obtained.  The first
 shows the nasogastric tube curled within the thoracic esophagus with tip
 extending to the superior portion of the image.  The second displays an
 appropriately positioned nasogastric tube with tip beyond the inferior edge of
 the image and sidehole within the stomach.  Both show moderate bilateral
 unchanged pleural effusions and left greater than right basal opacities, most
 compatible with atelectasis.  Left-sided PICC terminates in the upper SVC. 
 Cardiac size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory position of NG tube with unchanged moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions and left greater than right basal atelectasis.
