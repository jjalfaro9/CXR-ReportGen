                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Low back pain, history of prostate cancer, chronic heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, preexisting pleural
 effusions have completely resolved.  The alignment of the sternal wires is
 constant and the heart continues to be large, but is still within normal
 limits.  Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  The hilar structures are
 unremarkable.  In the retrocardiac lung area, better seen on the lateral than
 on the frontal radiograph, is an area of parenchymal scarring of
 mild-to-moderate extent.  There is no evidence of acute pulmonary changes such
 as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  The colon is interposed between the liver
 and the chest wall.
