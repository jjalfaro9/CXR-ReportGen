                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated  // Please eval interval change     
 Please eval interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 essentially unchanged. The patient has taken a better inspiration. Bibasilar
 opacifications persist, more prominent on the left.  Although some of this
 could merely represent atelectasis and small left effusion, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously
 considered, especially at the left base.
