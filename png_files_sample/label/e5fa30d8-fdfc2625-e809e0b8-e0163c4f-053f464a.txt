                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:04 P.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after CoreValve replacement.  Evaluate for
 possible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New mild interstitial edema and interval increase in caliber of mediastinal
 veins suggests mild cardiac decompensation.  New CoreValve noted in standard
 position.  New transvenous right ventricular temporary pacer lead follows the
 expected course.  No pneumothorax or evidence of mediastinal bleeding.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is new.  Apparent nodular opacity projecting over
 the left lower lung laterally should be re-evaluated with conventional
 radiographs when feasible.
