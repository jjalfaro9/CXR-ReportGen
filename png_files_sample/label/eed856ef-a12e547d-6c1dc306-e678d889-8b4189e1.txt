                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Thalamic bleed. Fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size. There is a prominent epicardial fat pad. The
 lungs appear clear. There is an expansile lytic area along the suspected along
 the anterior lateral fourth rib, which is incompletely characterized. There
 are streaky opacities in the adjacent parenchyma.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Possible lytic lesion in the left fourth rib with adjacent pulmonary
 parenchymal reaction which may indicate that the lesion is posttraumatic but
 the possibility of soft tissue mass should be considered.
 
 Initial further evaluation with dedicated left rib radiographs is suggested.
