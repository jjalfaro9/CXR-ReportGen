                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of CAD, CHF, CKD with dyspnea and
 hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads again terminating in the right
 atrium right ventricle, unchanged.  Low lung volumes persist with moderate
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette appearing unchanged.  Extensive
 atherosclerotic calcification the aortic knob.  Mediastinal and hilar contours
 are similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, as seen previously.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are without significant interval change. 
 Patchy opacities are again seen in the lung bases.  No new focal consolidation
 is evident.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No substantial interval change from the prior study.  Low lung volumes with
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but infection
 is difficult to exclude.
