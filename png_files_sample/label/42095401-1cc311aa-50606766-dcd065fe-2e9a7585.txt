                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  On chemotherapy, profound dyspnea with weakness. Rule out pneumonia
 versus PE. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CTA from ___, PET CT from ___ and
 chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Patient is
 status post right upper lobe resection, and surgical clips are again seen in
 the right hilar area. Relative prominence of right hilar branching opacities
 is compatible with known tumor, better assessed on prior PET CT.  There is no
 definite focal consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Status post right upper lobe resection,  prominence of right hilar
 branching opacities is compatible with known tumor, better assessed on prior
 PET CT. No acute cardiopulmonary findings.
