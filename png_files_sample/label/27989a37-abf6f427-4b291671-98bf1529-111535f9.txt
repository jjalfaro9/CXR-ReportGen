                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain and hyperglycemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is similar
 mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  On the frontal
 view only, there are streaky right basilar opacities, probably due to
 atelectasis; an infectious cause seems less likely.  Small osteophytes are
 noted along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy streaky right basilar opacities, suggestive of atelectasis
 although not entirely specific.
