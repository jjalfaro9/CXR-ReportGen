                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of elevated white blood
 cell count, shortness of breath. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 upper zone pulmonary vascular re-distribution and perivascular haze. 
 Additionally, there is blunting of the posterior bilateral costophrenic angles
 consistent with trace to small bilateral pleural effusions.  More confluent
 opacity at the right infrahilar region most likely relates to vascular
 structures and is somewhat similar as compared to the prior radiograph as
 opposed to underlying consolidation.  There is focal thickening of the white
 matter fissure which may be due to thickening or fluid within.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains top normal.  The mediastinal contours are stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Elevated central venous pressure and trace bilateral pleural
 effusions suggest degree of fluid overload/CHF.  More consolidative opacity at
 the right infrahilar region may be related to vascular structures although
 underlying consolidation not excluded.
