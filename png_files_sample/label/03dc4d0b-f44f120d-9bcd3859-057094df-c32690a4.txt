                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trach  // eval interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior radiograph of 2 days earlier, tracheostomy tube remains
 in place, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Left hemidiaphragm
 appears less distinct than on the prior, possibly due to small pleural
 effusion with adjacent atelectasis or developing pneumonia.  Short-term
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
