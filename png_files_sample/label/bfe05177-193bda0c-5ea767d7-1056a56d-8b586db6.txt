                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower.  There
 is minimal streaky linear opacification at the left base, most consistent with
 atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural
 effusion, or pneumothorax.  A stable vague opacity at the right cardiophrenic
 sulcus is unchanged, likely mediastinal fat.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is otherwise normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal left basilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia.
