                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Coronary artery disease, status post multiple stents,
 feeling lightheaded.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this,
 no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
 The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.  No overt
 pulmonary edema is seen.  Degenerative changes are partially seen along the
 spine.
 
 A linear lucency through the distal right clavicle is may be artifactual given
 patient history.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Linear lucency through the
 distal right clavicle may be artifactual given patient's history; correlate
 clinically.
