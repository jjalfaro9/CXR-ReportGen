                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with a followup for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___.
 
 Portable chest film dated ___ at ___ is submitted.  Patient positioning
 is not indicated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Patchy opacity at the right
 apex most likely corresponds to the known irregular mass seen on the recent CT
 dated ___.  There is some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and
 streaky opacities at both bases likely reflecting a diminished inspiration
 rather than an acute process.  No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax is appreciated, although if the patient was imaged in the supine
 position, the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax would be diminished. 
 Therefore, followup imaging would be advised.
