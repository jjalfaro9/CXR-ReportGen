                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with coughing and increased ___ requirement  //
 Pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema      Pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there has been the development of
 increased opacification in the left mid and upper lung zones and right upper
 zone.  This is associated with an apparent right and possibly also left
 pleural effusion.  The appearance is most suggestive radiographically of
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Although this usually is more prominent on the
 right, gravid patient all edema can occur on the left if the patient tends to
 lie on his left side.
 
 If pulmonary edema is a reasonable clinical possibility and there are no
 definite signs of superimposed pneumonia, the patient could undergo diuresis
 and a repeat study obtained to demonstrate whether the opacification has
 decreased.
