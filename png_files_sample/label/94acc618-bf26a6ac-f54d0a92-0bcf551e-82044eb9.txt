                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IN O.R.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ACDF, intubation  // serial exam, r/o pna,
 pulm edema      serial exam, r/o pna, pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube is not
 definitely seen.  Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification with poor
 definition of the hemidiaphragm again is consistent with pleural fluid and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Dense streak of atelectasis in the right
 mid zone is noted.
 Although no focal consolidation is appreciated, in the appropriate clinical
 setting, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
