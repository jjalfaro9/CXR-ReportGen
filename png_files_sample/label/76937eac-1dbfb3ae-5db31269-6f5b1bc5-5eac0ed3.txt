                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status and fever.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are low lung volumes.  The aorta is tortuous and appears dilated,
 unchanged.  Heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.  There is no pulmonary
 edema, with crowding of the bronchovascular structures noted.  Streaky
 bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis.  Infection is not excluded in the
 correct clinical setting.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded in the correct clinical
 setting.
