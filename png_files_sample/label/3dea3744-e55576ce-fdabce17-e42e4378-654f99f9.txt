                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single-lead pacemaker device terminates in the right ventricle. 
 The heart is moderately enlarged.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax, but fissures appear thickened.  There is a mild interstitial
 abnormality including haziness of pulmonary contours, suggesting mild
 pulmonary edema.  Mild bilateral pleural thickening along each lowe chest
 appears stable.  The chest is probably hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
