                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Stroke and intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  Pacer leads are in unchanged standard position. 
 Tracheostomy tube is in place.  NG tube tip is not well visualized, can be
 earlier followed through the mid to the lower esophagus.  Right IJ catheter
 tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacities left
 greater than right are unchanged, still worrisome for infection.  If any there
 is a small right effusion.
