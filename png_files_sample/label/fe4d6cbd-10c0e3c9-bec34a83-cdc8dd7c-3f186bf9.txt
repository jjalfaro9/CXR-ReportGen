                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mild chest pain, dizziness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Minimal ill-defined opacity in the right lung base is
 similar when compared to the prior study, and likely reflective of mild
 atelectasis and overlapping vascular structures.  No focal consolidation,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively noted.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.  Minimal patchy opacity
 in the right lung base, likely reflective of atelectasis and unchanged when
 compared to the prior exam.
