                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Syncope and elevated white cell count.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from___ dated earlier on the same
 day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The lungs are clear.  Small anterior osteophytes
 are noted along the mid to lower thoracic spine.  On the lateral view the
 extreme costophrenic sulci are excluded, but there is no positive evidence for
 pleural effusions or of pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
