                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with weakness and confusion. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained, limited by
 the patient's left upper extremity contracture deformity.
 
 FINDINGS:  Within the limitations above, the lungs are clear though
 hyperinflated.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 normal.  The aorta is somewhat tortuous, and measures up to 4.8 cm along its
 descending portion, and 4.9 cm at the arch.  There is degenerative change of
 the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints bilaterally. The patient is
 osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute chest pathology.
 2.  Likely aortic aneurysm, although not well evaluated on radiography and
 which would be better evaluated on a non-emergent basis with cross-sectional
 imaging.
