 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF and COPD, please evaluate for infectious
 process or collection  // ___ year old man with CHF and COPD, please evaluate
 for infectious process or collection
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The configuration of the chest suggests COPD.  Small pleural effusions or
 basal pleural scarring are present.  Heart size is normal and there is no
 pulmonary edema.  The architecture of the pulmonary vessels and bronchi is
 distorted in several areas. Aside from right apical scarring with
 bronchiectasis, it is difficult to characterize the other findings.
 Conceivably there are no active clinical significance.  There is no good
 evidence for pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Transvenous right AA atrial and
 ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the right pectoral generator.
