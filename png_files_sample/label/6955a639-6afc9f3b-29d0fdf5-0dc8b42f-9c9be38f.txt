 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHB s/p PPM  // PTX, leads      PTX, leads
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are new.  There is a suggestion of
 peribronchial infiltration lateral to the lower pole the right hilus.  It
 would be useful to obtain oblique radiographs now and repeat the examination
 in 2 weeks to see if this is a real finding.  Heart size is top-normal,
 increased since ___ along with increased caliber of the pulmonary
 vasculature suggesting mild cardiac decompensation.
 
 Right trans subclavian pacer leads follow their expected courses to the right
 atrium and right ventricle from the right pectoral generator.  No
 pneumothorax.  Mild gaseous distention of the esophagus above the thoracic
 inlet is not necessarily pathologic.
