                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Lung volumes are
 quite low which significantly limits evaluation.  There is left basal vague
 opacity which could reflect an early/mild pneumonia.  There is right lung base
 atelectasis with elevated right hemidiaphragm.  Heart size cannot be reliably
 assessed.  Mediastinal contour is also poorly assessed.  Bony structures
 appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited exam, lung volumes and basal atelectasis. 
 Pneumonia in the lower lungs cannot be excluded.
