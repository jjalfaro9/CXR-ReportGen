                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 4:56
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent CVA, hepatic failure, followup
 chest film.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study ___ at 4:54.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:56 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Given patient rotation, overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged.  Right internal jugular central line, left subclavian
 central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in
 position.  Left upper quadrant catheter is also again identified.  There is
 persisting consolidation in the retrocardiac area likely reflecting lower lobe
 collapse, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered.  There
 is likely an associated pleural effusion.  The right lung is grossly clear. 
 Overall, there has been slightly improved aeration at the right lung base.  No
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
