                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Apical pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 8:59.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A left pigtail chest tube tip projects over the left upper lung field. 
 Previously seen left apical pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the
 current exam.  There does appear to be a small air-fluid level posteriorly on
 the left which could reflect a small loculated hydropneumothorax.  Re-
 demonstrated is subcutaneous emphysema within the left neck and chest wall. 
 Left basilar patchy opacity likely reflects atelectasis.  Minimal atelectasis
 is also noted in the right lung base.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, and no pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Previously noted left apical pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the
 current exam, though there does appear to be a small loculated
 hydropneumothorax posteriorly on the left.  Left basilar atelectasis.
