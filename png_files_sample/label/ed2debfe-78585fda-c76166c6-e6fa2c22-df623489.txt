                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  To rule out rib fractures/pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest views were reviewed.  The study was reviewed
 in comparison with prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lungs are well expanded without any opacities concerning for
 pneumonia or aspiration or atelectasis.  There is no pleural abnormality. 
 This study is non-dedicated for evaluation of the bone pathology.  Within the
 limitations, there is no evidence of rib fractures.  Heart size is top normal.
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.  Lungs are clear.
 2.  Note, this study is non-dedicated for evaluation of the bone pathology. 
 Within the limitations, there are no obvious rib fractures; however, if
 clinical concern continues, dedicated rib views with markers placed at site of
 suspected fracture should be considered.
