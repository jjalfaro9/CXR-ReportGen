                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recurrent severe C. difficile infection,
 hypertension, and coronary artery disease.  Elevated white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  There is no good evidence for pneumonia.  Small left
 pleural effusion may be present and small lung lesions would not be
 appreciated.  Nevertheless, I do not believe there is justification for CT
 scanning of the chest in order to elucidate signs and symptoms of infection. 
 The upper esophagus appears to be distended with air.  Clinical correlation
 advised.
