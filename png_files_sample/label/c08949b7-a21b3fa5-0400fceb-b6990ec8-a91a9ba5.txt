                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sternal wound infection status post closure, fever.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and ___.
 
 Left subclavian PIC line is present, tip over mid/lower SVC.  Positioning
 appears similar to the chest x-ray from ___.  External lines overlying the
 chest may represent EKG leads outside the patient. 
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly, with mediastinal clips.  No sternotomy wires are
 identified at this time.  On the lateral view, the sternum is poorly
 visualized due to overlying artifact from the patient's arm.  
 
 Compared with ___, the sternotomy wires have been removed.  No obvious
 pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is detected.  Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  No
 CHF is detected.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base, unchanged. 
 Slight blunting of both costophrenic angles posteriorly and some patchy
 opacity in the lower lobe is new compared with a lateral view from ___.  
 Slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  PIC line tip over mid/lower SVC.
 
 2.  Cardiomegaly, essentially unchanged.
 
 3.  Minimal patchy opacity at the right base is unchanged compared with
 ___, but new compared with ___ and could reflect the presence of a
 pneumonic infiltrate. Otherwise, no focal infiltrates are detected.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions seen posteriorly are also new compared with
 ___.
