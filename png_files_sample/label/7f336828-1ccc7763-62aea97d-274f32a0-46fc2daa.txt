 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the
 appearance of the substantial right and smaller left pleural effusion.  Left
 chest tube is in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  What
 appeared to be a right chest tube on the previous study is no longer seen and
 there is no evidence of pneumothorax on this side.
 Monitoring support devices are otherwise unchanged.  Again is some element of
 pulmonary edema.
