                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Recently started on
 Coumadin.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angles
 suggestive of trace effusions.  Apparent increased density projecting over the
 right upper lung laterally thought to be in part due to rotation and a
 superimposed pleural thickening in the setting of multiple old posterior and
 lateral rib fractures.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable in
 configuration.  Post-kyphoplasty changes are seen in the lower thoracic level
 as well as compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine, unchanged from
 CTPA from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral effusions on the right.  Cardiomegaly without
 definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
