                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened, consistent with
 COPD.  In addition, the left hemidiaphragm is elevated, with some air-filled
 loops of bowel underlying it.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent. 
 The possibility of a hiatal hernia cannot be excluded.  The aorta is unfolded.
 Rounded densities overlying the left hilum are incompletely characterized, but
 may very well represent vessels seen on end.  There is minimal upper zone
 redistribution, but no overt CHF.  There is some patchy opacity in the right
 cardiophrenic region without definite infiltrate.  The costophrenic sulci are
 grossly clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probable background COPD.  No definite infiltrate.  No effusion
 or overt CHF.
