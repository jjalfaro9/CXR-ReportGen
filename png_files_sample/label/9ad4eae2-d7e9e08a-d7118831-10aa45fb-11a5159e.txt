                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea and chest pain, here to evaluate
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent
 prior study.  Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be related to
 atelectasis and, less likely a small left pleural effusion.  Increased streaky
 opacification of the left heart border likely represents left basilar
 atelectasis.  No right pleural effusion is detected.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  The cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged, which is accentuated in the setting of low lung
 volumes but likely stable allowing for differences in AP technique and low
 lung volumes on today's examination compared to the prior study.  The thoracic
 aorta is slightly tortuous.  The trachea is midline.  There is no evidence of
 free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 Note is made of a density projecting over the inferior right hilum, which is
 not seen on the prior study.  The azygos vein appears prominent.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely unchanged from the prior
 study allowing for differences in technique and lower lung volumes.
 3.  Right inferior hilar density measuring approximately 2.3 cm for which
 additional imaging on a non-urgent basis is recommended with dedicated PA and
 lateral chest radiographs possibly followed by cross-sectional imaging.
 
 The patient was admitted and the above findings were discussed by Dr. ___
 with Dr. ___ ___ internal medicine via telephone at 4:30PM on ___.
