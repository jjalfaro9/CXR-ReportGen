                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with multiple myeloma presenting with altered mental
 status.  // any evidence of PNA?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the left. There are relatively low lung volumes.
 Obscuration of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to overlying soft
 tissue, although trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  Patchy
 medial right base opacity has been present over multiple priors and most
 likely relates to overlying vascular structures although underlying
 consolidation is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Aorta knob is
 calcified. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy medial right base opacity has been present over multiple priors and
 most likely relates to overlying vascular structures although underlying
 consolidation is not excluded. Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views when
 patient able for further evaluation. Central vascular congestion again noted.
