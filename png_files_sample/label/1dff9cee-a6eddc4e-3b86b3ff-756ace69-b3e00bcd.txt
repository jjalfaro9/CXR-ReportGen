                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:49 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after liver transplant.  Assess Dobbhoff tube
 placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Three images are provided. #1 shows a feeding tube with the wire stylet in
 place looping in the lower esophagus, #2 with the loop in the upper esophagus,
 and #3 with the tube in the upper stomach, less distended with air and fluid
 than in the earlier two images.
 
 Lungs are low in volume but essentially clear.  This exaggerates mild
 cardiomegaly.  There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  Findings were
 discussed by telephone with the patient's nurse at 3:10PM.
