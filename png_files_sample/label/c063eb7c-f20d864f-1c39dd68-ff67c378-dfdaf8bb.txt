 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  GI bleed with question of acute intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  Clips are also noted
 in the right neck soft tissues.  There are low lung volumes and
 underpenetrated technique which limits evaluation of the left lung base. 
 Interstitial edema is present without large pleural effusion seen.  Heart size
 is top normal with aortic calcifications again noted.  Bony structures appear
 intact, though degenerative changes and high-riding right humeral head noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema with mild cardiomegaly.
