                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left-sided chest pain.  Evaluate for pneumothorax or rib
 fracture.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest, PA and lateral.  The lungs are clear.  The hilar and
 cardiomediastinal contours normal.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  No displaced rib fracture is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2.  No displaced rib fracture is seen, however, this is an insensitive test
 for that indication.  If there is clinical concern for rib fracture, dedicated
 rib radiographs with a skin marker locating the patient's symptoms is
 suggested.
