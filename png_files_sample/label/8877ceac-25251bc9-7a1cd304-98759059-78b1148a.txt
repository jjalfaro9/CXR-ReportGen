 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the nasogastric tube is been removed and
 replaced with a Dobhoff tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach. 
 Continued low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the transverse
 diameter of the heart.  Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration the
 hemidiaphragm is again consistent with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and pleural effusion.  Increasing opacification at the right base
 suggests small pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis at this side as well.
 There is engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with
 increasing pulmonary venous congestion.
