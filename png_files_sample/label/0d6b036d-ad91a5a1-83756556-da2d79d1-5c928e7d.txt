                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Productive cough, dyspnea for three days and crackles
 halfway up in the left lung, question pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The heart is normal
 in size, though stable.  There is no frank edema, effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Subtle retrocardiac opacity on the frontal projection is not substantiated on
 the lateral projection and could represent slight changes in ventilation. 
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Bony structures are intact.  A catheter is
 seen projecting over the left hemiabdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Top normal heart size without convincing signs of pneumonia or
 CHF.
