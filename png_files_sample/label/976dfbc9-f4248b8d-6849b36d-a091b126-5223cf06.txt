                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with severe AS with R basilar crackles  // PNA?
 Pleural effusions? edema?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is again enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, bilateral
 pleural effusions, and compressive basilar atelectasis. There is a somewhat
 illl-defined area of increased opacification at the right base. Although this
 could merely reflect an area of vascular congestion, in the appropriate
 clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
