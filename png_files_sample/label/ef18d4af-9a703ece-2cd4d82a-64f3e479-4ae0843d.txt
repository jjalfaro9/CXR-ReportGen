 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 05:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film dated ___ at 05:47 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube unchanged in position. Bilateral diffuse parenchymal
 opacities are more confluent in the left upper lung and in the right mid and
 lower lung.  When compared to the prior study, there is no significant
 interval change given differences in technique and positioning.  No pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces are seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely stable given patient rotation on the current study.
