                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 relatively low lung volumes.  There is slight prominence of the interstitial
 markings which may be due to mild pulmonary edema versus less likely atypical
 infection.  There is slight blunting of the posterior right costophrenic angle
 and a trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are likely accentuated by low lung volumes and AP technique.
