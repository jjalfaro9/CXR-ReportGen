                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:16 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman in septic shock related to neutropenia, colitis
 and possible flare of Crohn's disease.  Aggressive volume resuscitation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, most recently 3:47 p.m.:
 
 Greater opacification of the lung bases is due largely to increasing
 small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis and mild dependent
 edema in the setting of very low lung volumes.  The upper lungs do not have
 the appearance of pulmonary edema and the heart is not enlarged.  Mediastinal
 veins are mildly dilated.  ET tube is in standard placement.  Sharp definition
 of the upper margin of the tracheal cuff suggests pooling secretions. 
 Nasogastric tube has been partially withdrawn, with the side port now just
 above the gastroesophageal junction warranting advancement by several
 centimeters.  Right jugular line ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
