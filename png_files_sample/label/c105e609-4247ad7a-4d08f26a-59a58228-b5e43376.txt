                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with VAP finishing abx course w/mild temp
 elevations and tachycardia  // interval change     interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification
 at the left base consistent with worsening pleural fluid and substantial
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 Otherwise, little change.  Continued blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 with right basilar opacification that could well represent merely atelectasis,
 though mild residual of consolidation cannot be definitely excluded,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
