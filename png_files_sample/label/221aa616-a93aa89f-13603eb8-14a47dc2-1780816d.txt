 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with MDS with new fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest.  There is asymmetric density
 projecting over the left ___ costochondral junction when compared to the
 right.  This could be due to degenerative changes.  However given vague
 opacity in Raiders triangle on the lateral view, shallow obliques are
 suggested to confirm.  Elsewhere, at the lungs are clear.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.  Asymmetric density projecting over
 the left ___ costochondral junction which is likely degenerative in nature
 however shallow bilateral oblique suggested to confirm.
