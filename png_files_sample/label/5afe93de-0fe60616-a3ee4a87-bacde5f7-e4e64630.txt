                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New cough and shortness of breath, assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation is seen to suggest
 pneumonia.  Haziness in the left lung base is likely scarring and chronic lung
 disease.  Deformities of the left rib cage likely related to old rib
 fractures.  Heart size is enlarged.  Calcifications within the aortic arch are
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
