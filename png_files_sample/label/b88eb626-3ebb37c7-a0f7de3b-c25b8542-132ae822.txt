                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with cough // eval infx process
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.
 
 Mild basal atelectasis noted.  Lungs are otherwise clear though hyperinflated
 and somewhat lucent likely reflecting known emphysema.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free air below the
 right hemidiaphragm.  Calcifications are prominent in the right and left neck
 likely reflecting prominent carotid bulb calcification.  Bony defect at the
 right distal clavicle may reflect acute or chronic injury for which clinical
 correlation advised.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Emphysema with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
 2. Prominent carotid bulb calcifications and a carotid ultrasound may be
 considered to further assess.
 3. Bony defect at the right distal clavicle, correlate for focal pain as an
 acute fracture difficult to exclude.
