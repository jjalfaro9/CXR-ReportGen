 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusions, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, there is an increase in
 extent of the right pleural effusion.  This effusion reaches the height of
 approximatively 5-6 cm and causes mild atelectasis at the right lung bases. 
 On the left, the effusion is minimal and seen on the lateral radiograph only. 
 The appearance of the lung parenchyma is unchanged.  Moderate tortuosity of
 the thoracic aorta.  No pneumonia, no other relevant abnormalities.  The right
 pleural drain is in unchanged position.
