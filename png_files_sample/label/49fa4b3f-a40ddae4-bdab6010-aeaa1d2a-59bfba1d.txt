                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bronchietasis/ILD on 3L home O2 presenting
 with constipation found to have worsened ___ edema  // r/o pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP and lateral images of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___,
 ___, ___, and ___ and CT chest from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is persistent interstitial lung disease with greatly decreased lung
 volumes, similar to prior exam.  There has been interval increase in reticular
 opacities in the bilateral lower lobes, with slightly more confluent opacity
 seen in the left lower lobe.  There is no pleural effusion, which suggests the
 increased reticular opacities are most likely related to interval progression
 of known pulmonary fibrotic changes. There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in reticular opacities in the bilateral lower lobes, with
 slightly more confluent opacity seen in the left lower lobe.  In the absence
 of pleural effusion, this most likely represents interval progression of known
 pulmonary fibrotic changes.  If clinical concern for pulmonary edema persists,
 the patient could be re-imaged after diuresis for further evaluation.
