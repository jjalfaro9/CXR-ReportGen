                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepatic hydrothorax, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___, again seen is increased opacity at the right base. 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, this is likely similar to the earlier
 film.  No new opacity is identified.  The left lung remains grossly clear,
 without effusion.  Mediastinum remains midline.  Doubt CHF.  No pneumothorax
 is detected at the lung apex and no fluid level is seen on the single view to
 suggest a hydropneumothorax.  Correlation with additional clinical history may
 help for further characterization.
