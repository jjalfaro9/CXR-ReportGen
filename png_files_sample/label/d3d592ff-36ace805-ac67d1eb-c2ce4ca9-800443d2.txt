                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, loss of consciousness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Again,
 leftward shift of the mediastinum and volume loss is noted within the left
 hemithorax.  Findings are grossly similar to chest CT scout image from
 ___.  There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may
 be due to pleural thickening and scarring, although a trace pleural effusion
 is difficult to exclude.  While a relative opacity projecting over the left
 mid-to-lower lung may relate to low lung volumes, scarring and
 post-pleurodesis changes, underlying layering pleural effusion or pulmonary
 contusion are difficult to exclude.  The right lung is clear.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 unremarkable.  No displaced fracture is seen.
