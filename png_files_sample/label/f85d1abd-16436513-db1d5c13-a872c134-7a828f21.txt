                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with AML  // eval for pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ chest radiograph, the ground-glass and reticular
 opacities with mid and lower lung predominance have substantially improved and
 may reflect improving opportunistic infection, drug reaction, pulmonary edema,
 or hemorrhage.  A new vertically oriented opacity in the periphery of the
 right upper lung may potentially represent focal atelectasis or may be a
 component of the more diffuse lung process.  No other relevant change.
