                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Rule out pulmonary pathology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  Compared to the
 prior radiograph, there is no significant change.  The heart, hilar and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is prominence of the superior right
 mediastinum, which is likely due to tortuosity of the brachiocephalic vessels.
 The lungs are clear.  No pleural abnormality is detected.
 
 Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are again noted.  Calcific
 densities in the area of the glenoid are also again seen, likely representing
 loose bodies.
 
 Again noted is the rightward displacement of the lower cervical trachea,
 consistent with a left sided thyroid mass.  This is unchanged compared to the
 prior radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  No relevant change since the
 prior radiograph.
