                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with hepatic hydrothorax
 after chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Left pigtail catheter is in place.  There is still opacification of the entire
 left hemithorax and even more pronounced than previously right mediastinal
 shift, thus most likely there is no interval decrease in the volume of left
 pleural effusion demonstrated.  There is no definitive evidence of right
 pleural effusion, but small amount is most likely present.  There is opacity
 projecting over the right hemithorax, adjacent to lateral aspect of seventh
 posterior rib, might potentially represent a callus, more pronounced than on
 the prior study. Correlation with dedicated rib views is recommended, since
 other abnormality such a pleural lesion or lung lesion cannot be excluded. No
 pneumothorax is present.
