                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, hypotension and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some asymmetry of
 markings at the base with increased opacification on the left.  This could
 represent merely some atelectatic change.  However, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
