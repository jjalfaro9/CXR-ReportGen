  Interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube. Initial images demonstrate the tube
  terminating in the distal esophagus just proximal to the gastroesophageal
  junction, but subsequent images demonstrate the tube within the stomach. Other
  than slightly lower lung volumes with increased bronchovascular crowding, the
  remainder the exam is largely unchanged.
