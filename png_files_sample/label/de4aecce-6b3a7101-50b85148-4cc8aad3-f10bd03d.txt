                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.  Moderate
 sized hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  Small right pleural effusion has
 increased in size since the prior radiograph and is accompanied by worsening
 right lower lobe opacity which probably reflects atelectasis.  Left lower lobe
 opacity has improved, however, with residual patchy and linear atelectasis
 remaining.  Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema is unchanged.
