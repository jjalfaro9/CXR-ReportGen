                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, hypoxia, mild cough  // Please evaluate for
 PNA, cardiomegaly
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained with the
 patient in the upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___,.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are again noted.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, with upper
 zone redistribution. No frank consolidation, overt CHF, or pleural effusion is
 detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for
 technique and low inspiratory volumes.  Slight aortic calcification may be
 present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes, with bibasilar atelectasis and upper zone redistribution.
 These findings could be accentuated by low lung volumes.  No definite
 consolidation, though an early infectious infiltrate might be difficult to
 exclude in this setting.
