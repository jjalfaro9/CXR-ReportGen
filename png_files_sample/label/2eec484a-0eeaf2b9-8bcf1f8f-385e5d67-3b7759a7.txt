                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY DATED ___ WITH NO PRIOR CHEST X-RAYS FOR
 COMPARISON
 
 Comparison is made to separately dictated CT of the neck from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Focal leftward displacement of the trachea above the thoracic inlet
 level appears to be due to an adjacent tortuous vessel on recent CT neck of
 ___.  Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable, and
 pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Within the lungs, band-like opacities in the
 right lower lobe are suggestive of atelectasis.  Lungs and pleural surfaces
 are otherwise clear, and note is made of mild right hemidiaphragm elevation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy and linear right lower lobe opacities are suggestive of
 atelectasis, but coexisting aspiration is possible given clinical suspicion
 for this entity.
