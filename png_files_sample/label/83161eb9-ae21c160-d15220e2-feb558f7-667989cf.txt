                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  The lungs
 are well expanded and grossly clear.  There are no pleural effusions or acute
 skeletal findings.
 
 Note is made of previous wedge resection in the right lung.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No conventional radiographic evidence of pulmonary metastases. 
 CT is more sensitive for detecting small nodules and may be helpful if
 clinical suspicion for metastases is high.
