                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cough,  hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation.  Cardiac silhouette size
 is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable.  Lung
 volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures.  There is
 probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Patchy bibasilar airspace
 opacities are noted, with possible trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  No acute osseous abnormality is present.  Remote
 fracture of multiple left sided ribs and the left mid clavicle are re-
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion and possible small bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, nonspecific, and may
 reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
