                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with complicated past medical history including
 RCC now with new AFib/flutter, status post amiodarone conversion.  Baseline
 chest x-ray for presumed prolonged amiodarone administration.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Severe dextroscoliosis is present.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  Given scoliotic deformity, the heart size is
 difficult to assess although it appears within normal limits.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear normal.  Mild blunting of costophrenic angles is again
 seen and is unchanged from prior examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Marked scoliotic deformity with no radiographic evidence of an
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
