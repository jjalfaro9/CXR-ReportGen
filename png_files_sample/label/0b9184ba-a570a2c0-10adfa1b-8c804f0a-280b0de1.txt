                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with chronic cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 A left-sided Hickman catheter terminates over the expected location of the
 cavoatrial junction.  The distal tip is not well visualized, therefore
 function of the catheter should be assessed clinically.  Thoracolumbar
 hardware appears in standard unchanged position, though is incompletely
 evaluated on this single frontal view.  Compared to the prior examination, the
 aeration of the lungs has significantly improved.  There is no focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural
 effusions.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
