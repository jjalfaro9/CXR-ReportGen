                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  Left tibia fracture with paraplegia.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs; prior lumbar spine radiographs are
 available from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.

 mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs appear clear.  The patient is
 status post posterior the thoracolumbar fusion.  Fracture and displacement of
 pedicle screws is noted at the uppermost level with increased degree of
 retraction since the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 2.  Some interval retraction of pedicle screws at the uppermost level of prior
 posterior thoracolumbar fusion, although already fractured previously.
