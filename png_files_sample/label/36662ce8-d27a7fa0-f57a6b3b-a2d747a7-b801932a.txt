                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:11 A.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with pneumonia.  Question interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___
 The widesrpead, diffuse coarse nodular abnormality in the lungs improved from
 ___ to ___, worsened again on ___ and has not
 subsequently changed.  Heart size transiently improved during this sequence
 suggesting some component of cardiogenic edema.  The radiographic abnormality
 is probably multifactorial.  I suspect residual bronchopneumonia from what was
 earlier much more multifocal consolidation.  Pleural effusions are presumed
 but not substantial.  Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.  No
 pneumothorax.
