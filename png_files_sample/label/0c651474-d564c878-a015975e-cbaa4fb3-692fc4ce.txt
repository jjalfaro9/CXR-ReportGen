                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:48 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The patient has severe emphysema, chronic cardiomegaly, pulmonary
 hypertension.  Over the years, left lower lobe has been intermittently
 collapsed or consolidated, presumably due to pneumonia.  Left lower lobe has
 been largely airless during this hospitalization, today more so than on
 ___, and there is also more opacification at the right lung
 base today than on those prior days.  The combination raises concern for
 continuing aspiration responsible for atelectasis and/or developing pneumonia.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are still present.  No pneumothorax.
