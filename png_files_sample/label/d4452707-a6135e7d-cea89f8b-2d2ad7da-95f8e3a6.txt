                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Restrained driver versus guardrail, transferred from OSH with
 multiple complex injuries.  Pulmonary etiology for fever.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lordotic positioning, with low inspiratory volumes.  
 
 A tracheostomy is in place.  Compared to the prior film, there is increased
 opacity at the right lung base, not fully characterized -- 
 ?effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  
 
 Again seen is patchy and more confluent opacity at the left base, consistent
 with collapse and/or consolidation.  There is suggestion of pulmonary vascular
 plethora, but this is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by surrounding pulmonary findings and
 accentuated by low lung volumes -- no definite change compared with the prior
 film.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Compared with ___ and ___, findings at the right lung base have
 progressed.
