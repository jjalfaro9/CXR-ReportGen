                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after mechanical mitral
 valve replacement, assessment for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable.  The stents in the right subclavian
 artery and vein are in place.  The replaced mitral valve is in expected
 position.  Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate to large associated with
 atelectasis, and there is no pneumothorax.  As compared to the prior study,
 the amount of pleural effusion has decreased substantially.
