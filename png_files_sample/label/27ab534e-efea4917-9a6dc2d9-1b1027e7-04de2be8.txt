                                 FINAL REPORT
 COMPARISONS:  Yesterday, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Repeat PA and lordotic views of the chest were interpreted in
 conjunction with PA and lateral radiographs from yesterday.  There is no
 suspicious lesion at the right apex at the site of prior concern.  No
 additional nodule, consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Questionable opacity at the right apex is not apparent on these
 subsequent views and was likely artifact secondary to summation of shadows.
