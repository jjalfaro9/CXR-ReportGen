                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, rule out CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Motion degradation on the lateral view limits assesment. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly.  A
 left pacemaker defibrillator is present with tips terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle as expected.  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion, similar compared to the most
 recent prior study.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable mild pulmonary vascular congestion with small pleural
 effusions.
