                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP erect portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is rotated to the right and the chin overlies the right upper lung. 
 Radiology technologist indicated best image possible, the patient
 nonresponsive and unable to move chin up.
 
 The patient's chin overlies the right upper lobe, obscuring the view.  There
 are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Low lung
 volumes also likely accentuate the mediastinum, which appears widened but
 likely unchanged compared to prior radiographs.  Difficult to exclude trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No focal consolidation is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal study due to low lung volumes with the patient's chin
 overlying the right upper lobe.  Low lung volumes accentuate the
 bronchovascular markings and likely cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Suggest
 repeat radiographs with better positioning/inspiratory effort when/if the
 patient is able.
