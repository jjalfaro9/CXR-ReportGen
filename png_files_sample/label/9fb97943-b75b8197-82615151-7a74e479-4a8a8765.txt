                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Stroke and poor baseline mental status.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study, ___.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left side, are increasing. 
 Right lower opacities are likely atelectasis.  Opacities on the left
 retrocardiac area have markedly increased; It could be due to atelectasis,
 although superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Left perihilar
 atelectasis has minimally increased.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly
 is obscured by the pleural parenchymal abnormality.  Degenerative changes are
 in the thoracic spine.
