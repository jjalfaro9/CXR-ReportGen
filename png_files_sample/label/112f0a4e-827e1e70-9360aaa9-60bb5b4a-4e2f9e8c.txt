                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fall off bed with neck pain and confusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with single lead terminating in the right
 ventricle.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Moderate to
 severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The
 mediastinal contour is similar.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 without frank pulmonary edema.  Increased fluid is loculated within the right
 minor and major fissures.  Small left pleural effusion is relatively
 unchanged.  Increased patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bilateral pleural calcification is again noted at the
 bases.  Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are again noted in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased fluid loculated within the right-sided fissures.  Unchanged trace
 left pleural effusion.
 2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 3. Increased patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis,
 though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded in the correct
 clinical setting.
