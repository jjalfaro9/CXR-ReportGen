                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chest pain, epigastric and left upper
 quadrant pain.  Evaluate for acute process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:02 a.m.
 
 Portable AP upright chest on ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left-sided pacer remains in place.  Heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are likely stable given patient rotation on the current study.  There
 has been interval slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, where there is
 now patchy opacity which may reflect atelectasis, although an early infectious
 process should also be considered.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. Prominent
 interstitium likely reflects age-related changes.  No pneumothorax. 
 Radiopaque material projecting over one of the upper lumbar vertebrae is again
 seen consistent with prior vertebroplasty.  Mild gaseous distention of the
 stomach.
