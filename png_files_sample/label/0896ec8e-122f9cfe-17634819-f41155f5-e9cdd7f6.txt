                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Glioblastoma with bacterial meningitis and hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are substantially lower
 lung volumes, which may account for much of the apparent increase in
 transverse diameter of the heart.  No evidence of vascular congestion.  There
 is some retrocardiac opacification medially.  It is unclear how much of this
 could represent some volume loss or even consolidation in the lower lobe and
 how much could merely be a manifestation of low lung volumes and the supine
 portable technique.  If clinically possible, lateral view would be extremely
 helpful.
 
 The right IJ catheter extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction or
 possibly in the upper portion of the right atrium itself.
