                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Decrease in size of pericardial effusion following placement of
 pericardial drain.  Moderate left pleural effusion has also apparently
 slightly decreased in size with persistent adjacent left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Right lower lobe peribronchial thickening and adjacent opacity
 is worse compared to the prior study, and could reflect aspiration, early
 infection or asymmetrical edema.
