                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A moderate size left pleural effusion has increased since the previous
 radiograph. Left basilar opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis.
 Heart size is difficult to ascertain given the presence of the left pleural
 effusion. The mediastinal contours are similar with diffuse atherosclerotic
 calcification of the aorta again noted. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No
 pneumothorax is detected. A trace right pleural effusion is similar compared
 to the prior study. There is minimal atelectasis in the right lung base. Mild
 degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased size of moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar compressive
 atelectasis. Unchanged small right pleural effusion and minimal right basilar
 atelectasis.
