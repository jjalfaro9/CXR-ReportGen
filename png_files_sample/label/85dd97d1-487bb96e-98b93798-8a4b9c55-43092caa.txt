                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain radiating to the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest, PA and lateral.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The lungs appear clear aside from streaky right
 basilar opacities that have shifted slightly in morphology again suggesting
 atelectasis or scarring.  A patchy left basilar opacity also suggests minor
 atelectasis or scarring that is likewise unchanged.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  Small osteophytes are noted along the upper
 thoracic spine with mildly narrowed interspaces.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy basilar opacities suggesting minor atelectasis; otherwise
 unremarkable.
