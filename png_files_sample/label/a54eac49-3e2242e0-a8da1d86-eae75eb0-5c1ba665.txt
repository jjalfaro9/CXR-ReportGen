                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 1 EXAM
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pneumonia  // acut eprocess, ng tube
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.8 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present -- tip and side-port extent beneath the diaphragm, with tip
 extending off the film.  Right IJ central line tip overlying proximal SVC. No
 pneumothorax detected.  Multiple clips are again seen overlying the upper
 mediastinum.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears prominent, similar to the prior film.
 Relative opacity in the region of the azygos vein is similar to the prior
 study.
 
 There appear to be small to moderate-sized bilateral effusions, with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film.  There is
 vascular plethora, slightly more than the prior study, suggesting mild CHF,
 though this could also be due redistribution from bibasilar
 collapse/consolidation.
 
 Opacity in the region of the splenic flexure presumably represents residual
 oral contrast in the colon.  Has there been a recent administration of oral
 contrast.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to the prior film, there appears to be increased vascular plethora,
 which could reflect increased CHF.  Please see comments above.
 
 Cardiomegaly and increased opacity in the right paratracheal/ azygos vein
 region is unchanged.
 
 Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation and bilateral effusions are similar
 prior.
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  Clips noted over upper mediastinum, unchanged.
 
 Oral contrast noted in splenic flexure.
