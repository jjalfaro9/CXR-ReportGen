                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of patient status post cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to overlying trauma backboard. 
 Endotracheal tube is high, the tip is 7.1 cm above the carina.  An enteric
 tube is visualized traversing through the stomach with tip out of the field of
 view.  There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with
 increased central venous pressure.  Additionally, there is a focal opacity
 overlying the right middle and lower lobes suggestive of atelectasis, possibly
 due to aspiration.
