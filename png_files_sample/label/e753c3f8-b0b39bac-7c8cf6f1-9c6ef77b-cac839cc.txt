                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 Lateral view shows either a 13mm lobulated retrosternal lung nodule or
 calicification in a consternal junction or prevascular lymph node.  CT
 scanning will be necessary to make the distinction, as posted in the online of
 critical imaging findings, for direct communication to the referring
 physician.
