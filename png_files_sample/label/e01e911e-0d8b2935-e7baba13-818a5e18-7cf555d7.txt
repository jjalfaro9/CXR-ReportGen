                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Interval change.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 a day before.
 
 The left PICC line tip is in brachiocephalic vein.  Heart size and mediastinum
 are unchanged in appearance.  Loculated effusion within the minor fissure on
 the right has a typical lens shape form consistent with psudo tumor. 
 Mediastinal drains are noted, grossly unchanged in appearance since the prior
 study.
