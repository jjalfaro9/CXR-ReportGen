                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact sternal wires and
 moderate cardiomegaly.  The lungs are fairly well-aerated, without focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax.  There is minimal blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, which may represent a trace pleural effusion.  The
 visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No focal consolidation.  Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may
 represent a trace pleural effusion.
