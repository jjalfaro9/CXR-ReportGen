 TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Re- demonstrated is left infrahilar opacity consistent with chronic post
 treatment changes, with underlying volume loss and bronchiectasis, better
 characterized on prior CT.  Increased bibasilar opacities are seen compared
 the prior study which may be due to infection, aspiration, disease progression
 not excluded.  There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be
 due to a trace pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased bibasilar opacities as compared to the prior study, may be due to
 infection, aspiration, disease progression not excluded.
 
 Small right pleural effusion.
