 FINDINGS:
 
 Single semi-erect portable AP view of the chest was obtained.  The patient is

 apex.  There are low lung volumes.  Skinfold overlies the chest.  There has
 been interval removal of the previously seen left PICC.  There are low lung
 volumes and bibasilar atelectases.  No large pleural effusion is seen,
 although a small effusion would be difficult to exclude.  No focal
 consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
