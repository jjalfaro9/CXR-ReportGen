                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with cough.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding.  Additionally, there is patchy opacity within the
 right lung base which appears to project over the supine and lateral view,
 findings concerning for pneumonia and/or pulmonary vascular congestion.  No
 overt interstitial edema is identified.  There is no pleural effusion.  The
 thoracic aorta remains tortuous.  Mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours
 appear within normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacity may reflect early pneumonia and/or
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
