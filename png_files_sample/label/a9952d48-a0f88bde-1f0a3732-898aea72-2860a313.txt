                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with left-sided posterior rib pain after sports
 injury, assess for fractures ribs 4 through 7.
 
 COMPARISONS: None
 
 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The lungs are low lung volumes, giving the appearance
 of bronchovascular crowding.  No pneumothorax or focal consolidation is seen.
 However, on the lateral view posterior pleural thickening is seen which may
 localize to the left chest on the frontal. Given the patient's history of
 trauma this finding is concerning for hemothorax after trauma. No rib
 fractures are identified. The heart is normal in size with normal
 cardiomediastinal contours.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Posterior, possibly left, pleural thickening could reflect
 hemothorax in the setting of trauma. Imaging with dedicated rib views in an
 urgent/emergent fashion is recommended to assess for rib views. 
 
 This was relayed to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ by phone.
