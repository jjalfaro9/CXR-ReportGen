                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent intubation, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lordotic positioning.  Compared with ___ at 8:19 a.m., the ET tube and NG
 tube have been removed.  Again seen is cardiomegaly with left ventricular
 configuration.  There is more pronounced upper zone redistribution and diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity is
 similar.  Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Worsening CHF with interstitial edema.  To some degree, this could be
 accentuated by supine positioning on today's exam versus semi-erect
 positioning on the prior exam.  Therefore, clinical correlation is requested. 
 
 
 2) Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
