 HISTORY:  History of right-sided chest pain.  Please evaluate for acute
 process.  
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
 Overall, the background density of the lung interstitium is abnormally
 increased, which appears chronic, and is likely secondary to emphysema. No
 consolidations concerning for acute pneumonia are identified. There are no
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia identified.
 
 2. Increased background density of the lung interstitium is abnormally
 increased, which is chronic and likely secondary to emphysema, however these
 findings would have more clinical significance if the patient was
 immunocompromised.
