                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Head and neck pain, thoracic tenderness.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  Cervical
 and thoracic spine hardware is again seen, similar in appearance.  The
 superior vena cava stent/filter is again seen, similar in appearance as
 compared to the prior study, though partially obscured by the spinal hardware.
 No focal consolidation is seen.  There is slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle which may be due to mild pleural thickening, although trace
 pleural effusion is not excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  Anchor screws are noted overlying the left humeral head.  No definite
 acute fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to a
 trace pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation.
