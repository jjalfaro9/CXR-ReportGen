                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman presenting with chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Low lung
 volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  There is mild bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 Increased interstitial markings particularly at the bases may be due to
 chronic lung disease. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinal silhouettes and
 hilar contours are stable allowing for low lung volumes.  Degenerative change
 is seen in the left shoulder girdle.  There is no free air under the
 diaphragm.  No displaced rib fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
