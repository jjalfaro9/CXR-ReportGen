                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS: ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with chest pain and abdominal pain.  Question
 acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  The patient is somewhat slanted towards the left.  Left
 basilar opacity likely due to atelectasis.  The lungs are clear of definite
 consolidation or effusion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is again notable
 for mild cardiomegaly.  Two linear mettalic densities now project over the
 lower neck, potentially external in nature.  Surgical clips in the right upper
 quadrant suggests prior cholecystectomy.  No free air identified below the
 diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
