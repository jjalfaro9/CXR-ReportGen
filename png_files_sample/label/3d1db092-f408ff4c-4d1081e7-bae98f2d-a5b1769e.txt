                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided chest tube remains in place with a persistent very
 small right apicolateral pneumothorax.  Small right pleural effusion has
 slightly increased in size adjacent to the lateral costophrenic sulcus, but an
 intrafissural component of the pleural effusion is smaller.  Bilateral
 asymmetrically distributed interstitial opacities have improved, likely
 representing asymmetric edema.  Heterogeneous opacities in right mid and right
 lower lung also appear slightly better.  Nodular opacity at left lung base
 probably represents a nipple shadow in the absence of a lung nodule in this
 region on prior CT of ___.  Prominent right mediastinal and hilar
 contours are suggestive of lymphadenopathy.
