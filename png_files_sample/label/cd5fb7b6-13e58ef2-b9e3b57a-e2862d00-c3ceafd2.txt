 rule out pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___.
 
 On the frontal view lungs are fully expanded clear, cardiomediastinal and
 hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
 
 On the lateral view projecting just anterior to the lower thoracic spine,
 roughly at the level of T9, is a 10 mm wide oval opacity which could be
 nothing more than the superimposition of overlapping ribs and vessels, it
 could be pulmonary nodule.  It should be re-evaluated with repeat chest
 radiographs in several weeks.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat chest radiographs in 4 weeks.  This study should be
 shown to a radiologist before the patient leaves the department to see if
 shallow oblique lateral views are indicated.
