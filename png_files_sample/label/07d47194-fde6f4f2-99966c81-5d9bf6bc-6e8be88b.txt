                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pleuritic chest pain
 of one day.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal.  Lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Normal chest radiograph.
 
 Note is made that this study neither confirms nor excludes the possibility of
 pulmonary embolism and if clinically suspected, further assessment with chest
 CT/pulmonary angiography should be considered.
