                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post right-sided thoracotomy
 with plication of diaphragm and subsequent pulmonary infiltrates.  Followup
 examination.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study ___ ___.  Since the next preceding study, a previously present right-sided
 PICC line has been removed.  Heart size and mediastinal structures remain
 unchanged.  The previously persistent remnants of the more massive infiltrates
 in the right upper lobe and middle lobe area have further regressed and
 constitutes now with only some linear disease pointing towards a local pleural
 thickening in the lateral axillary wall of the chest.  No new infiltrates are
 seen.  The right-sided diaphragm remains mildly elevated as before, but there
 is no evidence of residual pleural effusion as the lateral and posterior
 pleural sinuses are free.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Comparison is
 extended to an upright chest examination dated ___ and obtained
 at___.  Comparison demonstrates that the diaphragmatic contours
 are now slightly lower positioned after the diaphragmatic plication operation
 of ___.  If diaphragmatic function has improved cannot be assessed on
 routine chest images.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further regression of parenchymal infiltrates in right
 hemithorax, now barely constituting scar formations.  No new abnormalities.
