                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low. The heart size is unchanged, and within normal
 limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar compared to the prior
 exam. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated. Linear opacities within the left lung base likely
 reflect subsegmental atelectasis. More patchy opacities in the lung bases also
 likely reflect atelectasis due to low lung volumes. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with patchy opacities at the lung bases likely reflective of
 atelectasis.
