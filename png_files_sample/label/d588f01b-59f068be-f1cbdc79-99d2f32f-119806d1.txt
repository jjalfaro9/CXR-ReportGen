                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:25 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia, suspect pneumothorax, pneumonia, or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Greater opacification in the left lower chest is probably due to increasing
 left pleural effusion, responsible in part for return of the cardiac
 silhouette to the midline, even though there still substantial left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube is obscured by spinal
 stabilization rods.  It probably still ends substantially above the upper
 margin of the clavicles.  As before, the loop of nasogastric tubing in the
 upper midline could be in the hypopharynx, although the tube ends in the low
 stomach.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9:28 a.m. to report these findings.
