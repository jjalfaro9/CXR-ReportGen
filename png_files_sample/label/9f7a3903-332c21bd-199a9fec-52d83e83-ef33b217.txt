                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shortness of breath, question pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs are markedly limited by the
 patient's body habitus.  Linear opacities projecting over the lungs are most
 likely attributable to soft tissue.  Bibasilar atelectasis is mild.  The hila
 are well defined.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal.  Ill-defined rounded opacities along the
 right anterolateral ribs may represent callous from prior fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited chest radiograph due to body habitus.  No pulmonary
 edema. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
