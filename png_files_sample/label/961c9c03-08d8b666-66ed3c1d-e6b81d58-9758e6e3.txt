                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post VT/VF arrest.  Study
 requested for evaluation of line placement and pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there

 bilateral right basal and left perihilar parenchymal opacities remain
 unchanged.  The morphology and location of these opacities suggest a
 combination of pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  No
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Monitoring and support devices remain in
 unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable diffuse bilateral opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema
 and/or pneumonia.
