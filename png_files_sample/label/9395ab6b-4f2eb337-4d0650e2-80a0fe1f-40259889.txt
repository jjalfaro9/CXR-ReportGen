 INDICATION:  ___M with decreased energy  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT cervical spine ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Fullness of the right hilum is
 noted.  The left hilum is unremarkable in appearance. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are well-expanded and note is made of
 increased reticular and nodular opacities at the left lung apex. The upper
 abdomen is unremarkable. Compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral
 body is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased reticular and nodular opacities at the left lung apex. Given the
 corresponding appearance on the CT cervical spine, this finding is concerning
 for post primary tuberculosis.  Standard clinical evaluation and precautions
 for post primary TB are recommended. CT may also be considered for further
 characterization and to better assess fullness of the right hilar region
