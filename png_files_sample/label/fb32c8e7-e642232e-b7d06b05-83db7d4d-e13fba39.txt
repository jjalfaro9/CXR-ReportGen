                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The pulmonary vasculature is
 indistinct, compatible with edema.  Bibasilar opacities have increased since
 the prior examination and remain compatible with atelectasis.  Bilateral
 costophrenic angles are obscured, compatible with small effusions.  No
 pneumothorax. No radiopaque foreign body.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
 2.  Bibasilar linear opacities, compatible with atelectasis.
 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly.
