                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, liver transplant with ascites, increasing
 shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. The mediastinal
 contour is unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic
 knob. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly worse in the interval with moderate
 size bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size. Patchy opacities in the
 lung bases, more so on the right likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No
 pneumothorax is present. Degenerative changes are again noted within the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema and moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, worse in
 the interval. Bibasilar atelectasis.
