                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia, trach  // Interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the recent study of 1 day earlier, pulmonary vascular
 congestion has slightly improved, and the right lung base is slightly better
 aerated.  Right pigtail pleural catheter appears slightly changed in
 orientation, but positional differences between the exams limit comparison. 
 Small right pleural effusion is a persistent finding.  Remainder of the exam
 is unchanged.
