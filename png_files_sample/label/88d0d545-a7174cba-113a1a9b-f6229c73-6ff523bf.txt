                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with diaphoresis, agitation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly decreased compared to the prior exam. This causes
 exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette size which is likely unchanged and top
 normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable accounting for low
 lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt
 pulmonary edema is present. Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
