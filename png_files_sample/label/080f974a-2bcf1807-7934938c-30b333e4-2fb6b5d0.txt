                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change
 and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  Continued hyperexpansion of
 the lungs suggests some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.  However, no
 acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
