                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Severe fatigue, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. 
 This may account for the apparent increase in the transverse diameter of the
 heart.  Substantial tortuosity of the aorta is again seen.  Mild atelectatic
 changes are noted at the left base.
 
 No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
