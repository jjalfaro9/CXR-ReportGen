                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with SOB and COPD  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. Biapical scarring and increased interstitial
 markings are seen throughout the lungs likely due to patient's underlying
 COPD. There is no focal consolidation worrisome for infection. Nodular opacity
 projecting over the anterior right fifth rib which may represent the nipple
 shadow in should be followed on subsequent exams. Calcified densities
 projecting over the right axilla are presumably in the soft tissues.
 Additional adjacent calcific densities projecting over the right lateral lung
 are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Atherosclerotic
 calcifications again noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Hyperinflation without focal consolidation.
 Followup on future exams of the nodular opacity over the right mid lung
 suggested.
