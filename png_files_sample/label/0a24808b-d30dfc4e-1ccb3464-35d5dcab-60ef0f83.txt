                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Cough, dullness in the left lower hemithorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT chest, ___.
 
 Large left pleural effusion is unchanged obscuring most of the left lung.  The
 right lung is grossly clear.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.  The
 remaining aerated lungs are hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged large left pleural effusion, underlying lung pathology
 cannot be excluded.
