                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sarcoidosis, dyspnea on exertion, rounded
 density on lateral view (bone density) overlying T7 but not seen on AP view. 
 // ? lesion on CXR
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  Impression FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In addition to the clear peribronchovascular infiltration and fibrosis in the
 upper lungs, less severe micro nodulation and early fibrosis is present in the
 lower lungs laterally and has progressed slightly since ___.  Although
 this could be a community acquired lung infection, I suspect sarcoid or other
 granulomatous infection.  There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central
 lymph node enlargement in the heart is normal size.
 
 I do not see a focal opacity corresponding to the described lesion described
 in the requisition.  If there is particular concern for a pulmonary nodule,
 other than sarcoidosis, CT scanning would be the only way to investigate it.
