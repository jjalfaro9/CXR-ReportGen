                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  Lungs and
 pleural surfaces are clear.  Exam was not specifically tailored to evaluate
 for rib abnormalities, but no acute, displaced rib fractures evident within
 this limitation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary radiographic abnormality.
 2.  No acute, displaced rib fracture.  If there remains strong clinical
 suspicion for acute rib abnormality, coned-down dedicated rib views at the
 site of pain may be helpful if warranted clinically.
