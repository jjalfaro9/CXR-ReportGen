  Lung volumes are low, which leads to bronchovascular crowding.  There are
  opacities seen at the bilateral lung bases on the lateral view.  While this
  may represent atelectasis, developing consolidation cannot be excluded in the
  appropriate clinical setting.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with fever and cough  // ? PNA      ? PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is somewhat ill-defined
 opacification posteriorly silhouetting what appears to be the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Similarly, there is some asymmetric opacification at the right
 base on the frontal view.  The findings are consistent with right lower lobe
 pneumonia.
 Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base but there is no evidence of
 vascular congestion.
