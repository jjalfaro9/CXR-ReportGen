 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough, chills and malaise, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are symmetrically well expanded and well aerated without
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary
 vasculature is slightly prominent, but grossly stable.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
 limits.  Mild calcification of the aortic knob is noted and unchanged from the
 prior study.  The trachea is midline.  Chronic appearing deformity of the
 distal right clavicle is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal consolidation.
