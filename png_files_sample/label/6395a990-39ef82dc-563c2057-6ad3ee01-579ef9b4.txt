                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough, elevated WBC  // r/o pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  Within the limits of plain film radiography, no
 hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected.  No CHF, focal infiltrate or
 gross effusion is identified.  There is slight blunting of the right and left
 costophrenic angles both laterally and posteriorly.
 
 The upper edge of the right lung at the right lung apex is visualized -- by
 doubt, but cannot entirely exclude a tiny right pneumothorax, though reported
 symptoms are not suggestive of fat.  Alternatively, this could represent a
 chronic appearance due to chronic scarring.
 
 No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.  The previously seen subdiaphragmatic
 free air (___ radiograph) have resolved.  Multiple clips are again noted in
 the left upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No focal infiltrate identified to suggest pneumonia.
 2. Minimal bilateral pleural fluid and/or thickening.
 3. Curvilinear lucency at the right lung apex.  In the absence of relevant
 symptoms, this more likely represents a subtle change due to chronic scarring
 than a true tiny right apical pneumothorax.
