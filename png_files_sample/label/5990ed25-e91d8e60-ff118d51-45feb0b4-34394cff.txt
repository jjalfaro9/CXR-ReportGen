                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with dyspnea  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___. 
 Chest CT and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There has been significant increase in widespread, bilateral pulmonary
 opacities which are likely related to the patient's known disseminated
 pulmonary metastases and possible underlying pulmonary infection. Of note,
 there is notably increased opacity at the base of the right lung and at the
 right apex suggesting pneumonia.  There is no large pleural effusion.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are grossly
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread pulmonary opacities are markedly increased from ___. 
 In particular, there is increased density at the base of the right lung and at
 the right apex suggesting pneumonia in the setting of known, widespread
 pulmonary metastatic disease.  The differential would also include
 superimposed CHF.
