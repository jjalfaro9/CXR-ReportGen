                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to a pleural effusion and
 atelectasis.  Perihilar opacities are likely due to mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Single-lead
 left-sided AICD is seen with the lead extending to the expected position of
 the right atrium.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  There is mild
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  Aortic knob calcifications are seen. 
 There is a rounded 8-mm sclerotic focus in the left proximal humerus, which is
 nonspecific but could represent a bone island in the absence of known history
 of malignancy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema.  Left base retrocardiac opacity and obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm may be due to pleural effusion with atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation not excluded.
