                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pneumothorax at outside hospital
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation. The patient's chin
 and neck obscures assessment of the right apex limiting the assessment for
 pneumothorax. No pneumothorax is grossly identified. Left basilar chest tube
 has been removed. Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position.  Heart size
 appears mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous but unchanged. Fiducial seed is
 again demonstrated in a known right lower lung mass with continued right lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Small to moderate size right pleural effusion is re-
 demonstrated. Worsening asymmetric increased interstitial markings on the
 right are noted as well as new focal consolidative opacity within the right
 lower lobe adjacent to the minor fissure. Small left pleural effusion is
 noted.  Left lung is hyperinflated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Limited study. No pneumothorax identified, though assessment for a
 right-sided small apical pneumothorax is difficult on this exam.
 2. New focal consolidative opacity in the right upper lobe is concerning for
 pneumonia. Worsening interstitial opacities in the right lung may be
 reflective of asymmetric pulmonary edema and/or lymphangitic spread of tumor.
 3. Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
