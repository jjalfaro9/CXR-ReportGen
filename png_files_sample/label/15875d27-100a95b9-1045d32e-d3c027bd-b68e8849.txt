 INDICATION:  ___M with unresponsiveness s/p intubation  // eval tube
 placementEval for intracranial bleed
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 Bibasilar opacities are likely due to layering effusions. The upper lung
 fields appear normal. A rounded retrocardiac opacity is seen, which is
 suspicious for hiatal hernia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged,
 likely accentuated by technique. Degenerative changes are seen within the left
 shoulder. An endotracheal tube is seen terminating 3.2 cm above the carina.  A
 dual pacing device is seen within the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.
 
 2. Bibasilar opacities are seen in the lower lung fields, likely layering
 effusions. Probable moderate hiatal hernia.
