                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough, altered mental status.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CTA ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged, with mild calcification noted at the aortic arch.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is mildly prominent suggesting congestion, but is slightly
 improved compared to the prior exam.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle on
 the frontal view likely reflects chronic pleural thickening.  There is streaky
 opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflective of atelectasis.  No focal
 consolidation is identified, and there is no pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural
 thickening is and unchanged.  Deformity of the left chest wall is re-
 demonstrated.  Multiple clips are noted within the posterior mediastinum.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal left basilar atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion,
 improved compared to the prior exam.
