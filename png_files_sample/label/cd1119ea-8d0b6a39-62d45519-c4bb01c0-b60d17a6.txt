                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___ ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary
 artery bypass surgery.  Lung volumes are low.  Allowing for this factor,
 cardiomediastinal contours are probably stable, but difficult to compare due
 to differing inspiratory levels between the exams.  The relatively low lung
 volumes results in crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases,
 but no confluent areas of consolidation are evident, and there are no definite
 pleural effusions.  Left hemidiaphragm remains moderately elevated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with minor bibasilar atelectasis but no findings
 to suggest acute pneumonia.  If symptoms persist, repeat chest radiograph with
 improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more complete evaluation of the
 lungs.
 
 Chronic elevation of left hemidiaphragm.
