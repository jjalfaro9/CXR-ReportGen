 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  CLL, bibasilar pneumonia, cough, worsening dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement,
 but no complete resolution, of the bilateral basal changes reflecting
 multifocal pneumonia.  A minimal accompanying pleural effusion on the right
 persists.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta, without evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
