                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Back and shoulder pain after a fall, on Plavix.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mild to moderately enlarged.  The heart is moderately
 tortuous with calcifications visualized along the arch.  Allowing for
 differences in technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is indistinct with upper zone
 redistribution and there is very slight interstitial prominence, the
 appearance suggesting mild vascular congestion or fluid overload.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate degenerative changes involve the
 right glenohumeral joint.  Small osteophytes are noted along the lower
 thoracic spine.  Although views of bony detail are limited, there is no
 definite evidence for fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion or fluid overload,
 without definite evidence for injury.
