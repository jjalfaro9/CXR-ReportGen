                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post right lower lobectomy.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates the patient in a
 very oblique position, making it difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs. 
 The right lung is less visualized on this radiograph, which may be secondary
 to positioning of the patient.  An thoracostomy tube is seen projecting over
 the right hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Obliquity of the patient makes interpretation difficult.  There
 is decreased visualization of the right lung, which may be secondary to
 positioning.
