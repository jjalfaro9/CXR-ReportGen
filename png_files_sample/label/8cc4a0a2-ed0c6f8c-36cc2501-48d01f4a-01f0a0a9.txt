                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Question nodule versus nipple on admission for
 shallow oblique views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 CHEST, THREE VIEWS.  Nipple markers placed.  One of the nodular densities seen
 at left base on the prior film likely corresponds to a nipple shadow on the
 current examination.  A curvilinear density at the left base seen on both
 films appears to represent calcification in the anterior rib cartilage. 
 Otherwise, no significant change.  No acute pulmonary process identified.
