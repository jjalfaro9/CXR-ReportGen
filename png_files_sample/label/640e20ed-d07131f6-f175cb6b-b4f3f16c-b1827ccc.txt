                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  History of lung cancer presenting with dyspnea,
 bilateral lower extremity edema, nausea, vomiting, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Nodular opacity in the lateral right lower lobe is again seen and
 appears slightly larger as compared to the prior study.  Medial right lower
 lobe nodular opacity is better assessed on CT.  There is persistent large area
 of opacity in the left mid to lower hemithorax which is seen represent a
 chronic mass-like consolidation with adjacent pleural thickening and possible
 necrosis on prior CT.  Additional pulmonary nodules in the left mid lung zone
 are again noted.  There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 likely related to atelectasis/pleural thickening with possible small pleural
 effusion.  Postoperative changes seen at the right upper to mid hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Grossly stable left mid to lower hemithorax opacities.  Lateral right
 lower lobe nodular opacity again seen, may be slightly larger in size.
 
 2.  The known second medial right lower lobe area of soft tissue is better
 assessed on CT.
