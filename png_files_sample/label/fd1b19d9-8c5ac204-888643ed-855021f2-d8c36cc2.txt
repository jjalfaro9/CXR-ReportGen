                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 7:35 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left effusion, evaluate size.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at 20:31.
 
 Portable upright chest film, ___ at 7:35, is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The nasogastric tube has been removed.  A right subclavian central line
 continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. 
 Status post median sternotomy and given rotation on the current examination,
 the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  There
 continues to be bilateral patchy airspace disease, left greater than right,
 with probable associated layering effusions, left greater than right. 
 Overall, when compared to prior study, there has been some interval
 improvement suggestive of resolving edema.  There is likely a component of
 compressive atelectasis, particularly at the left base.  Pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.
