 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of HIV and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Right
 perihilar opacity measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.7 cm, best seen on the
 frontal view, could be due to infection, although underlying pulmonary lesion
 is also not excluded.  Left lung is clear.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  There
 has been interval removal of a left-sided port seen on the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  3.5 x 2.7 cm somewhat ill-defined opacity in the right perihilar
 region/right mid lung best seen on the frontal view, could be due to
 underlying infection or pulmonary lesion.  Recommend followup to resolution,
 possible CT.
