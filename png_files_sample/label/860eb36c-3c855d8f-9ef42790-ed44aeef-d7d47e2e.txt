 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS.
 
 HISTORY:  Chest and bilateral arm pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged in comparing with the prior frontal scout
 view.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There are newly apparent
 opacities at the medial lung apex, probably bony in etiology, but it is
 difficult to exclude a lung nodule.  Otherwise the lung fields appear clear. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No evidence of acute disease.
 
 2.  Nodular density at the left lung apex; chest CT is recommended to evaluate
 further when clinically appropriate.
