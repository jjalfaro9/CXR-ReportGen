                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest x-ray PA and lateral
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD  // RNEW study screening, ___ to ___
 # ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is bi-apical pleural thickening and diffuse linear opacities in both
 lungs that are better characterized on the CT performed on the same date. 
 Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of bilateral hemidiaphragms,
 suggesting chronic pulmonary disease such as emphysema.  There is no evidence
 of pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is within normal limits.  Other than a pectus excavatum, there are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Lung hyperinflation with flattening of bilateral hemidiaphragms is
 consistent with emphysema.
 2. Bi-apical pleural thickening and diffuse bilateral linear opacities are
 better characterized on CT chest performed on the same date.
