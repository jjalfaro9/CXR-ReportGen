 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 454
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with sepsis, status post PTC placement, rule
 out pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 454 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular central
 line are unchanged position.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation which may represent
 partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also
 be considered.  There has been interval appearance of mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary and perihilar edema.  There has been slight interval improvement in
 the right basilar opacity suggesting a resolving atelectasis.  Small bilateral
 effusions are likely.  No pneumothorax.  Gastric distention has somewhat
 improved.
