                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cough  // eval for PNA.  Post mastectomy
 with history metastatic disease to the spine.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pacemaker is unchanged in position.  Aortic arch calcifications are re-
 demonstrated.  Right juxta hilar opacity, which could be projectional due to
 lordotic positioning, but is infection cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is largely unchanged.  A supradiaphragmatic descending aortic
 aneurysm appears unchanged.  Left basilar pleural parenchymal scarring is
 unchanged.  Note is made of prior right mastectomy and axillary lymph node
 dissection; diffuse skeletal metastases are again demonstrated
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right infrahilar opacity is potentially due to accentuation of pericardial fat
 pad by lordotic projection, of a localized region of atelectasis or infectious
 consolidation could have a similar radiographic appearance.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If continued clinical concern, more standard radiographic
 positioning radiograph may be obtained.
