 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.  The lungs
 appear well expanded and clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
 overt edema is seen.  The heart is stably and severely enlarged with unchanged
 tortuous aortic contour.  The width of the mediastinum appears grossly
 unchanged from prior AP chest radiograph.  Right neck plastic cannula is
 presumed to be for IV access.
