                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with pharyngeal perforation.  Evaluate for any
 improvement in pneumomediastinum.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are viewed in comparison with
 prior study from two days earlier.  Some linear atelectasis is seen in the
 right upper lobe and left retrocardiac region.  No pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum is visible.  Surgical clips are seen at the left axilla. 
 Slight prominence of the ascending thoracic aorta is present with heart and
 mediastinal contours within expected limits for study done with small degree
 of inspiration.  Focal kyphosis is seen at the thoracolumbar junction.
 
 CONCLUSION:  No visible pneumomediastinum.  Subsegmental atelectasis as
 described.
