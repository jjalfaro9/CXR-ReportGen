 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Septic shock, intubation, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a right internal jugular
 vein catheter was removed, and a right PICC line was newly inserted.  The tip
 of the line projects over the mid SVC.  There is no evidence of complications,
 notably no pneumothorax.  The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, the appearance of the lung parenchyma and the
 cardiac silhouette are unchanged.
