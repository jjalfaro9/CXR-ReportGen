                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Cough and fever, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  The heart size
 appears normal.  The aorta is unfolded.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.  There is mild prominence of the interstitial markings,
 which could reflect chronic disease.  There is no definite sign of CHF.  Bony
 structures appear intact.  There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite signs of pneumonia.  Coarsened interstitial markings
 likely reflect underlying chronic lung disease.
