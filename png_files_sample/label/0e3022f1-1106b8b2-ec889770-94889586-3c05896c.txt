                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with acute shortness of breath and wheezing.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available in the ___ system.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Linear density in the retrocardiac region
 appears to project over the spine on the lateral view.  The morphology
 suggests subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe, however, pneumonia
 is also a possibility in the appropriate clinical circumstance.  MInimal
 blunting of the right cp angle is present. The remainder of the lungs are
 clear.  There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Linear opacity in the left lower lobe, likely atelectasis, though pneumonia is
 possible in the appropriate clinical circumstance.
