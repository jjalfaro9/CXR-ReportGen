                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hypoxia, question pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.
 
 ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
 
 The lungs are low in volume but clear.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. 
 The mediastinal silhouette is widened.  The hilar contours and pleural
 surfaces are normal.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  An ET
 tube and NG tube are appropriate.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mildly widened mediastinum is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.  If an
 aortic injury is a clinical concern, then a CT of the chest may be obtained
 for further evaluation.
