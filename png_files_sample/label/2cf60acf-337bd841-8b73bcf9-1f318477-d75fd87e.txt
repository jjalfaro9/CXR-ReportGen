                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and cough.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again is seen a pacer unit in the right chest with leads
 terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Midline sternotomy wires
 are unchanged.  A left-sided central venous catheter tip terminates in the
 lower SVC.
 
 The heart size is enlarged but stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The lung volumes are low and bibasilar atelectasis is present, but
 improved. Small  bilateral pleural effusions persist, larger on the right than
 left, but the right-sided pleural effusion has decreased.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improving pleural effusions and parenchymal opacities, which may
 reflect atelectasis; superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded by this study,
 however.
