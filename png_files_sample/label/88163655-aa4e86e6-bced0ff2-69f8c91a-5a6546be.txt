                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea on exertion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The fact that the right cardiac contour is still minimally obscured suggests
 some degree of chronic atelectasis, but on the whole, although this area of
 minor opacification seems unchanged, opacities in the lower lungs have
 generally otherwise resolved. The lungs appear otherwise clear. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minor persistent atelectasis or scarring in the lingula, but otherwise clear
 lungs.
