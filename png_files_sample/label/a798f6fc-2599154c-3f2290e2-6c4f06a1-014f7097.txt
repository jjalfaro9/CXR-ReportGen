 leads following an expected course to the right atrium and proximal right
 ventricle, respectively.  
 
 The left hemidiaphragm is elevated by gas seen in the stomach or bowel. The
 heart is mildly enlarged. The hilar contours appear normal.  The left
 costophrenic angle is not well visualized but there is no right pleural
 effusion. There is a small bochdalek hernia seen on the lateral view. There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.
