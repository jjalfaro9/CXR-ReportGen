                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary edema  // Pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema appears unchanged with
 improved aeration of the right lung base, bilateral pleural effusions, right
 greater than left, are unchanged, and associated atelectasis is improved on
 the right and worse on the left.  Lung volumes remain low.  The tip of an
 endotracheal tube is seen 2.9 cm above the carina.  Severe cardiomegaly
 persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild improvement of moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema with improved
 aeration of the right lung base.
 2. Persistence of right upper lobe opacity could represent asymmetric edema or
 pneumonia.
