                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple rib fractures, please evaluate rib fractures.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___ and CT
 chest, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral upright radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The known rib fractures at T7, T9, and T10 are poorly visualized on
 routine PA and lateral radiographs and cannot be evaluated in detail. 
 However, there is no evidence of significant displacement.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lungs are clear and well expanded. 
 Evidence of prior aortic dissection repair is re-demonstrated.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  The hilar contours and pleural
 surfaces appear normal.  Spinal hardware is partially imaged and is not
 appreciably changed in position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Known posterior rib fractures at T7, T9, and T10 are poorly
 visualized with routine PA and lateral chest radiographs; however, there is no
 evidence of significant displacement.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
