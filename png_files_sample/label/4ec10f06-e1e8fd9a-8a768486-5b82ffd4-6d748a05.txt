 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 16:22, and particularly
 the chest CT and chest radiograph on ___ performed nearly concurrently.
 
 Chest CT on ___ showed multiple pulmonary nodules, moderate size right
 lower lobe pneumonia, left lower lobe collapse and small to moderate left
 pleural effusion.  Subsequent chest radiographs have shown increase right
 lower lobe pneumonia and some improvement in aeration of the previously
 collapsed left lower lobe now revealing large pneumonia on that side. 
 Moderate left pleural effusion is probably larger.  Heart size is normal. 
 Pulmonary vasculature is engorged but it is hard to say whether there is any
 pulmonary edema.
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Left internal jugular line ends in the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and
 out of view.  There is no pneumothorax.
