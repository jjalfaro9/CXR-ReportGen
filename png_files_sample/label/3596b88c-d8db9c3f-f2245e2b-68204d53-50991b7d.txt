                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:02 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain after right total hip replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Apparent interval increase in cardiac diameter is artifactual due to both
 supine positioning and AP projection.  Heart is moderately-to-severely
 enlarged, but not acutely changed.  Left atrial dilatation is quite severe,
 but there is no evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension, edema, or pleural
 effusion and no pneumothorax.  Configuration of two right ventricular pacer
 defibrillator leads and right atrial pacer lead are unchanged.
