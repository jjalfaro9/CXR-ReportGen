                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Non-small cell lung cancer presenting with cough and sputum for
 three days.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, whole
 body PET CT ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiographs, three views.
 
 FINDINGS:  Heart size is normal.  Left hilar contour is normal.  Compared to
 radiograph dated ___ there is increasing fullness of the right
 hilus with increased rounded densities along the minor fissure as well as
 increased right medial lung base peribronchial opacities with bronchial wall
 thickening and bronchiectasis.  Compared to the PET-CT from ___, these
 findings all appear to be present, however, are worse on today's exam.  Left
 lung is essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Worsening densities in the right hilus with increase in nodular densities
 along the minor fissure as well as increased peribronchial opacities and
 bronchiectasis in the right lung base which may represent worsening primary
 malignancy with superimposed infection.  Fissural densities may represent
 loculated effusion although local metastatic disease is not excluded.
 
 Results were discussed over the telephone with Dr. ___ over the
 telephone by ___ at 11:05 a.m. on ___ at the time of
 initial review.
