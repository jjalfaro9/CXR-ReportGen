 There is no right pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. There has been
 overall improvement in the bibasilar and right apical opacities since the most
 recent prior study. A tracheostomy tube is again noted in acceptable position.
 There has been interval removal of left internal jugular central venous
 catheter.  Again seen is a venous central line terminating near the inferior
 cavoatrial junction.  Contrast is seen in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall improvement with small residual left pleural effusion.
