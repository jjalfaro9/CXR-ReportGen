                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with sob  // eval pneumonia vs chf
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest port, 2 leads which
 project over the anticipated location of the right atrium and just below the
 superior cavoatrial junction.  There is a moderate-sized right pleural
 effusion which obscures the right heart border.  The left lung appears grossly
 clear, streaky opacity at the left lung base thought likely atelectatic. 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New relative to prior examination dated ___ is a moderate to
 large-sized right pleural effusion which obscures the right heart border.  No
 focal opacity convincing for pneumonia.
