                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SCLC, hemoptysis status-post arterial
 bleed, ?element of cardiogenic pulmonary edema versus ARDS // Evaluate for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  A nasogastric
 tube extends into the stomach, tip not visualized.  Right-sided volume loss,
 presumably due to right lower lobe collapse is unchanged.  Bilateral layering
 pleural effusions are also unchanged.  Extensive bilateral airspace opacities
 have improved. The patient has had previous axillary lymph node dissection. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits
 despite the projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Normal size heart size favors noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which has
 improved.
 Stable right lower lobe collapse.
 Stable layering pleural effusions.
