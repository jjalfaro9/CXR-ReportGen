                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M intubated, hypoxic
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment of the chest is limited by overlying trauma board and external
 devices.
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is slightly high, approximately 8.6 cm from the carina. 
 Enteric tube tip terminates in the stomach, however the side port is above the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Heart size is mildly enlarged.  Widening of the
 superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes, supine positioning, and
 AP technique.  Ill-defined opacities are seen within both upper lobes and
 likely within the medial aspect of the right lung base, which may reflect
 areas of aspiration.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified
 on this supine exam.  There is no overt pulmonary edema identified.  No
 displaced fractures are evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Study limited by overlying trauma board and external devices.
 2. Endotracheal tube tip is high terminating approximately 8.6 cm from the
 carina and would recommend advancement by at least 3 cm.
 3. Enteric tube tip is within the stomach though side port is above the
 gastroesophageal junction, and would recommend advancement by at least 7 cm.
 4. Ill-defined opacities in both upper lobes and likely within the medial
 aspect of the right lung base may reflect areas of aspiration.
