                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after aortic valve and
 mitral valve surgery.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The right internal jugular line tip
 is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Post-sternotomy wires are unchanged. 
 Replaced valves are unchanged.  There is interval progression of left
 retrocardiac opacity concerning for worsening of atelectasis.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions are present, most likely unchanged since the prior study,
 potentially minimally increased.  The patient continues to be in pulmonary
 edema that appears to be slightly worsened than on the prior study.  In
 addition, there is more confluent opacity in the right upper lung that might
 reflect asymmetric edema, but focal infectious process cannot be excluded and
 should be further followed on the subsequent radiographs.
